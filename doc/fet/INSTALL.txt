   extract the tar file, just above the pds-nccs source tree.
   so you have a directory that looks like so:

   ls  -CF
   fet/ pds-nccs/

   cd pds-nccs
   patch -p1 <../fet/doc/pds-nccs-fet-ingest.patch

   -- the above patch modifies bulletinManager.py to directly insert
      bulletins into the db, and link them to client directories.

   rather than have two trees lying around, copy the stuff into pds-nccs...

   cp ../fet/bin/* bin
   cp ../fet/lib/fet.py lib

   vi bin/fet bin/fetrx bin/fettx

   remove '../pds-nccs' in the sys.path.insert lines near the beginning of each
   because now fet is inside pds-nccs.

   mkdir /apps/fet
   mkdir /apps/fet/etc
   mkdir /apps/fet/etc/tx
   mkdir /apps/fet/etc/rx

   clients="Tandem Adonis FTPSVR2 PDSALPH METMGR1 MEMGR2 PDSALPH PDSOP QUACTRL"
   for c in $clients:
       mkdir /apps/fet/etc/tx/$c

   if you want to have files sent by FTP to a circuit, say castor, then configure

   /apps/fet/etc/tx/castor.conf
   --
   active yes
   log_roll_over  daily
   sleep_timer    10
   debug_level    3
   chmod          000
   destination ftp://am:Pr2namPW@castor/data/hoho/out WHATFN
   imask *:*:*:*:*
   --

   to use ncsSender, Daniel's priority sorting directory tree should be 
   pointed at /apps/fet/tx/<client>


   and that ought to work... you can look in /apps/fet/db/ for the database
   files, and just run the ncsReceiver without starting a sender to watch
   the client queues fill up.
