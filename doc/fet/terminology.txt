FET - File Exchange Tracker.

initial file hierarchy:
        FET_ROOT= /apps/fet
	FET_ROOT/db/<date>/
	FET_ROOT/rxq/<source>/[1..5]
	FET_ROOT/txq/<client>/[1..5]
        FET_ROOT/log/<client>,<qsrc>,<process>
        
        FET_ETC/
		fet.conf
		pdsswitch.conf  (optional)
	        tx/<client>.conf
		rx/<reception>.conf

     uses links extensively, chdir to FET_ROOT, and link relative.

receive files from 'sources' and deliver to clients


Directions:
all directions are relative to the entire machine, not any sub-component.
if files are on their way into the machine, they are rx (reception) files.
if they are on their way out from the machine, they are tx (transmission) files.

sample confusion to be avoided:
ie. PDS has 'incoming' as the name of the files which are outgoing from the server,
because they are 'incoming' to the client.  Such a directory name is very confusing.

clients:
     locations to which files are delivered.
     same terminology as the PDS.

sources 
     one (or more, depends on priority setting in config.)
     places where files can be received.

Reception name:
     Files are received with a "reception name" in the rxq.
     once the reception name is adjusted via a ('whattopds') type
     mapping, then the ingestname is generated from that.

Ingest name:
     Ingest name is used to store the file in the DB, as is.
     (names which will arrive with correct ingest names 
      files can be delivered directly to the inq)

     ingest name is mapped against patterns to find clients who 
     will be sent the file.

Destination name:
     destination file name, destfn, is calculated:
     default is first field of ingest name.
     add suffixes according to DESTFN parameter setting in pattern.

Direct routing:
     routing using a lookup table, tandem style, with direct correspondence
     between source and client.

Patterned or masked routing:
     traditional PDS routing, via client specific emasks & imasks
