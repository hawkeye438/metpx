start up the whole system:

   px start|stop


startup individual circuits...
   pxSender [--suppress_logging <num>] <client> (stop|start|reload) 
   pxReceiver [--suppress_debug <num>] <client> (stop|start|reload) 

the higher the number of logging suppresion, the less information will
be logged. default is 100 (suppress debug completely.) specify a number
less than 100 for more information.  (Yes this is wonky, it's not my
fault, look in the logging module at how the priorities are defined.
Yes, they are inverted from the UNIX standard... very odd ... PS)
here they are:

levels to set for various types of logging:
    CRITICAL = 50
    FATAL = 50
    ERROR = 40
    WARN = 30
    WARNING = 30
    INFO = 20
    DEBUG = 10
    VERYVERBOSE = 5
    VERYVERYVERBOSE = 3

header2client.conf -- the direct route mapping table. 
Each header is on it's own line, three fields per line, colon separated.
AHL on the left, list of destinations in the middle, priority is third field.
sample line:
SICA01 MSLP:A E C H S F O Q:5:

collectons_stations.conf -- the list of stations included in each collective bulletin.
space separated lines, first field is the AHL with the space removed, rest
are the four letter station id's for collections.

(OLD CONFIG: stnlist in etc.sample)

collections.conf -- configuration file for collection process.
  -- same as existing one.

-------------------------------------
For each reception circuit (a "source" in px parlance), there
is a configuration file in the rx directory.  by creating

samples of rx/<source>.conf

type single-file		
extension AMTCP2FILE:DADS:BULLETIN:ASCII:3

type single-file
extension AMTCP2FILE:DADS:BULLETIN:ASCII:4

type am
extension PPP1:-CCCC:-TT:pxRx:-CIRCUIT

type wmo
extension NWS:-CCCC:-TT:pxRx:-CIRCUIT


For each outgoing circuit, there 
-----------------------------
    sample etc/tx/ppp1_wmo.conf

type  single-file
protocol ftp
user iamwhatiam
password sdgasdg
host ppp1.cmc.ec.gc.ca
directory /tmp/data_wmo
filename  WHATFN
imask *:nwsA:*:*:* 

destination https://fred:fredpass@fredwether.com/disk1 WHATFN
imask *:nwsG:*:*:* 


For each circuit, there is a spooling/queueing/working directory.
/apps/px/rx/<source>  for sources, and /apps/px/tx/<client> for outgoing ones.
