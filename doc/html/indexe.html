<H1>MetPX - Open Source GTS Switching</H1>
<P>
Revised: $Date$
<p>
[<A HREF="indexf.html">fran&#231;ais</a>]
<P>
MetPX is a message switching system for use with <a href="http://www.wmo.int"> Wmo </a> Global Telecommunications System circuits based on TCP/IP. 
Developed at the Canadian Meteorological Centre of <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca">Environment Canada</a> for our own use.  
MetPX is a work in progress, the development process is being externalized in the hopes of fostering a community 
around a switching system which all can share and improve together.  The system is already production quality for a 
limited set of features and is in production use at the CMC as the core of our national bulletin switching 
infrastructure.   The software is under continuous, but low-intensity development.  Features are carefully being 
layered on top of existing stable functions.

Protocol support:
<UL>
<LI>AM (Canadian proprietary socket protocol) 
<LI>WMO (see manual 386 for the WMO TCP/IP socket protocol.)
<LI>FTP (for transport, no support for WMO naming yet (but trivial to add.))
<LI>SFTP (similar to FTP.)
<LI>AFTN/IP (NavCanada version of AFTN running on IP networks.) 
</UL>
<P>
features:
<UL>
<LI>detailed routing (in production with 30,000 distinct entries in the routing table.)
<LI>unified/similar for bulletins and files.
<LI>sub-second latency (with 28,000 routing entries.)
<LI>high speed routing and delivery. (was &gt;300 messages per second, but that was a year ago, and many features which might slow it down have been added, a re-test is in order.)
<LI>no message size limit.
<LI>message segmentation (for protocols such as AM &amp; WMO which have message length limits.)
<LI>duplicate suppression (on send.)
<LI>bulletin collections, NMC function for WMO. 
<LI>generalized filter mechanism.  (collections will be modified to fit this general mechanism.)
</UL>

<P>
There are two modules in the project right now, and a third under consideration.  Modules of 
MetPX are named after species of plant which are endangered in 
Canada (see <A HREF="http://www.speciesatrisk.gc.ca"> Species at Risk </a> for more details.)
<UL>
<LI>sundew: the WMO switching component.
<LI>columbo: the web based monitoring component, for both sundew, and the older (not released) PDS.
</UL>

Platform: Debian Linux (Sarge).  Any modern Linux should do. (stock 2.6 or 2.4 with many patches.)   Python &gt;2.3

There is not yet proper packaging.  We will tag a release when it is ready.  Sundew is 
rather stable for now, current work is on improving the installation process by 
implementing Debian packages.  A package for the sundew module should be available 
shortly (oh... before the end of 2007)  and for Columbo (Spring 2008.)  We are still
putting finishing touches on a first release version.  

For now, you can poke around by downloading the source code:

<A NAME="Source"><H3>Getting Source Code</H3>
<P>
Currently internal installations are done, one at a time, from source.  Development
is done on the trunk release.  When we install operationally, the process consists
of creating a branch, and running the branch on a staging system, and then implementing
on operational systems.  There are README and INSTALL files that can be used for 
installation of sundew.  One can follow those instructions and get an initial installed 
system.  
<P>
It is critical to install the cron cleanup jobs (mr-clean) since otherwise the 
server will slow down continuously over time until the system slows to a crawl.  If you 
Best bet is to subscribe to the mailing list and let us know what is stopping you from 
trying it out, it could inspire us to work on that bit faster to get some collaboration 
going.  
<P>
with those explanations, feel free to grab a snapshot can be obtained using subversion via:
<UL>
    svn co https://metpx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/metpx/trunk
</UL>

available for anonymous read-only access.

Other, somewhat similar software, no endorsements or judgements should be taken from these links:

<LI><A HREF="http://www.wmo.ch/web/www/ois/Operational_Information/WMO386/ManOnGTS.html">WMO Manual 386</A> The standard reference for this domain.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm</a>  - Local Data Manager.  LDM includes a network protocol, and it fundamentally wishes to exchange with other LDM systems.  This package was instructive in interesting ways, in the early 2000's there was an effort called NLDM which layered meteorological messaging over a standard TCP/IP protocol.  That effort died, however, but the inspiration of keeping the domain (weather) separate from the transport layer (TCP/IP) was an important motivation for MetPX.
