'active' <yes|no>
   whether this channel is 'on' or not.
   if it is not active, anything delivered into it's input queues will stay there.
   For sockets, that means the peer will not be able to connect.

'type' <am|wmo|plain|wmofile>
   am        	   - AM protocol socket
   wmo        	   - WMO protocol socket
   single-file     - Receive plain files (like a PDS.)
   single-bulletin - receive bulletins in a file (ingested like from a socket.)

'port' 5012
   port to bind for reception, only used on socket protocols

'extension' 1:AMTCP2FILE:DADS:BULLETIN:ASCII
 
  the reception file or bulletin name will have appended to it
  the following fields:

    priority, ori_system : ori_site : data_type : data_format :

  
arrival { 'CA':(5,20),'WO':(20,40) }
  mapping of what the valid times to receive a given type of bulletin are.
  in this example for CA's, -5 or +20 minutes versus the issue time is 
  the valid interval.

AddSMHeader true
  true if a header is to be inserted at the beginning of a SM or SI bulletins.
  the header is of the form: "AAXX jjhh4\\n".

  
FIXME: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
routing direct|pattern  
	be able to choose how the bulletin/file received is mapped to clients
	two methods exist: AHL lookup in header2clients.conf, or by 
        patterns (imask&emask)
