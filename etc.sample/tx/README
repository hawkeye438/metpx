directives

'active' <yes|no>
   whether this channel is 'on' or not.
   if it is not active, anything delivered into it's input queues will stay there.
   For sockets, that means no attempt to connect to remote will be made.

'type' <am|wmo|plain|wmofile>
   am        	   - AM protocol socket
   wmo        	   - WMO protocol socket
   single-file     - Receive plain files (like a PDS.)
   nwsfile         - receive bulletins in an archive
   ukmetfile       - receive bulletins in an archive
   wmofile         - receive bulletins in an archive

'destination' <URL> <DESTFN>
    Uniform Resource Locator to designate where a sender should connect to.
    ie.  wmo://localhost:5012
   
    One can issue multiple destination directives in a single client.
    but it there will be a severe performance penalty if delivering large
    numbers of files to two different machines using the same client.
    best to use separate clients, each with their own destination.

    There are also synonyms for subsets of 'destination'
    'protocol', 'host', 'user', 'password', 'directory', 'filename'
   
    


  
active yes
type wmo
destination wmo://localhost:5012
