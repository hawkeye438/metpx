<br>About
<br>---------------------
<br>This section was created to help the administrator of the stats library.
<br>The stats library was designed as to require as little human intervention as 
<br>possible. Nonetheless it is likely that errors will occur through time.
<br>A few utilities have been developped as to help the user get things back on track. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Section 1 - Data errors on only one machine.
<br>------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>Preconditions : 
<br>------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>- 2 or more machines currently have pxStats installed.
<br>
<br>- They BOTH have the same main application language set
<br>  in their config file.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Symptoms : (any of these)
<br>------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>1 - Different graphics are produced by both machines.
<br>
<br>2 - Some graphics are absent on one of the two machines
<br>    and not on the other.
<br>
<br>
<br>Possible causes :
<br>------------------------------------------------------
<br>1 - The two(or more) machines have different versions of
<br>    the stats library installed on them or different 
<br>    versions of the crucial files.
<br>
<br>2 - Graphic creation has been stopped on one of the two
<br>    machines.
<br>
<br>3 - Disks are full or access to disk is corrupted.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Recovery procedure:
<br>-----------------------------------------------------   
<br>1- Identify the source of the problem within the list 
<br>   of possible errors.
<br>
<br>2- If a machine has the wrong version of the stats 
<br>   library files installed, install the same version
<br>   as the working machine on the non-working machine.
<br>
<br>3- Stop all stats library related activities by killing
<br>   currently running process' and by turning off the
<br>   related crontab entries. To do so, run this commands : 
<br>   crontab -e  and write the # character in front of the 
<br>   entries you want to turn off. 
<br>
<br>4- Retrieve data from the working machine.
<br>
<br>   To do so run this utility :
<br>
<br>   .../pxStats/bin/tools/retreiveDataFromMachine.py login machineName  
<br>
<br>   Warning : prior to running this script, make sure that the config files in the 
<br>   .../pxStats/etc folder are properly filled !
<br>
<br>5- relaunch graphic production
<br>
<br>   To do so remove the # character you have placed in the crontab entries you have modified. 
<br>
<br>   Remove any lock found in one of these folders : 
<br>
<br>    ...pxStats/tmp/lockFiles/pxStatsStartup.lock
<br>    or into the 
<br>    .../pxStats/temp/fichiersDeVerrou/ folder and remove 
<br>
<br>   Note: if crontab entry is set at the 15th minute of the hour, and it's hh:25:ss
<br>         you might want to run launchGraphicCreation manually to see if everything goes well
<br>         without having to wait untill the next hour.   
<br>
<br>Warnings : The preceding script is not bulletproof. If files were being updated 
<br>           throughout the entire time the transfer was being done, there is no
<br>           way all the transferred files will be complete and accurate. You
<br>           should thus make sure that the source machine is not doing any 
<br>           intensive work of it's own(i.e stop the crons on that machine
<br>           during transfer). Otherwise, rerun this script numerous time.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Section 2 Data recuperation
<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Preconditions : 
<br>------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>- At least one machine has pxStats installed.
<br>
<br>- If only one of the machines has problems, the other
<br>  machines do not have the same installation languages
<br>  as the problematic one.
<br>
<br>- If many machiens have the same installation language
<br>  they either do not handle the same machines or they
<br>  are both currently corrupted.
<br>
<br>- If any of the preconditions is not met, see the other 
<br>  section to find the section relative to you problems.
<br>
<br>
<br>Symptoms : (any of these)
<br>------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>1 - Graphics are missing.
<br>
<br>2 - Graphics appear, but are empty.
<br>
<br>3 - Monitoring emails are no longer delivered.
<br>
<br>
<br>Possible causes :
<br>------------------------------------------------------
<br>1 - Crontabs have been stopped on all of the machines.
<br>
<br>2 - Disks are either full, or disk access has been lost.
<br>
<br>3 - Someone stopped crontab during execution and corrupted 
<br>   data. 
<br>
<br>4 - SSH access to remote access is corrupted 
<br>
<br>5- Emails transfers is corrupted.
<br>
<br>
<br>Recovery procedure:
<br>-----------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>1 - Make sure crontabs are currently active
<br>    - ssh userName@problematicMachine
<br>    - crontab -e 
<br>    - Make sure no '#' character is found in front 
<br>      of the crontab entry dedicated to pxStatsStartup 
<br>
<br>2 - Make sure disk space is sufficient and that disk are accessible.
<br>    -  ssh userName@problematicMachine
<br>    -  go to the .../pxStats/data or .../pxStats/donnees/ folder.
<br>    - Browse folders and see if the are ALL accessible.
<br>    - At the same time, verify every folder for free disk space
<br>      and make sure they are not full.
<br>
<br>4 - SSH connections are lost :
<br>    This will produce graphics with no data since no log files will be rsync'ed
<br>    from the source machines to the pickling machines.
<br>
<br>   - ssh username@problematicmachine
<br>   - make sure automatix connection to log producing files
<br>     is granted without password to the user which is running 
<br>     the crontabs.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>3 - In case of data courruption :(ssh connection had been lost, 
<br>    brutal halting of pxStatsStartup execution)
<br>
<br>     - ssh userName@problematicMachine
<br>     - crontab -e : comment the crontab entry of pxStatsStartup.py
<br>     - go to the .../pxStats/bin/debugTools/ folder
<br>     - execute the following command : 
<br>       setTimeOfLastUpdates.py "yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS"
<br>       the time specified should be the hour prior to data corruption 
<br>    - go to the .../pxStats/data/databases/databasesBackups and look
<br>      for the newest backup that is older than the time of courruption.
<br>
<br>    - copy that time exemple : 2008-05-04_12:16:00
<br>
<br>    - go to the .../pxStats/bin/tools folder and execute the following
<br>      command restoreRoundRobinDatabases.py "2008-05-04 12:16:00"
<br>      Note : don't forget to replace the _ character with a space.
<br>
<br>    - Go to the .../pxStats/temp/fichiersDeVerrou folder and 
<br>      remove all lock files found there.
<br>    
<br>    - Go to the ...pxStats/tmp/lockFiles/ and remove any lock 
<br>      files found there.
<br>    
<br>     - crontab -e : remove the # you had previously added to the entry.
<br>        
<br>
<br>5 - If everything seems ok but only monitoring emails are missing, 
<br>    go to the "Section 3  Missing emails " section to fix the email
<br>    problem
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Section 3  Missing emails 
<br>---------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Symptoms : (any of these)
<br>------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>1- Emails are no longer recevied from one or all of the machines
<br>
<br>
<br>Possible causes :
<br>------------------------------------------------------
<br>1 - Crontabs are stopped on those machines.
<br>
<br>2 - Email server is not distributing hte emails. 
<br>
<br>3 - You're client is not receiving emails.
<br>
<br>
<br>Recovery procedure:
<br>-----------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>1 - Verify if graphics are up to date on the problematic machine
<br>    If they are not, than a stopped crontab might be the cause.
<br>    
<br>    If so follow the following steps :
<br>
<br>        - ssh userName@problematicMachine
<br>        - To verify crontab type crontab - l
<br>        -  if entry starts with '#' 
<br>           example : #15 * * * * /apps/px/pxStatsFr/pxStats/bin/pxStatsStartup.py  > /dev/null 2>&1
<br>           remove the #
<br>        
<br>        - If not, verify if process is not allready running. If not,
<br>          verify if a lock file is blocking the program from running.
<br>            - Go into the 
<br>                ...pxStats/tmp/lockFiles/pxStatsStartup.lock
<br>              or into the 
<br>                .../pxStats/temp/fichiersDeVerrou/ folder and remove 
<br>              pxStatsStartup.verrou if it is present( french installation)
<br>            
<br>        - Make sure all the .py files found under 
<br>               .../pxStats/bin/ 
<br>          and all the folders under it have permissions
<br>          to be executed.
<br>    
<br>
<br>If graphics are up to date, than the program is running and the emails 
<br>seem to be the only problem
<br>
<br>2 - Verify if your e mail client is currently receiving emails properly. 
<br>
<br>3- Verify if the parameters found in the .../pxStats/etc/config 
<br>   configuration file are up to date. Verify with your email 
<br>   provider that these parameters can be used on it's server 
<br>   to send out emails.
<br>

<br>Section 4 Request interface problems
<br>----------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Symptoms( any of these ) :
<br>----------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br> - Request Page is not displayed at all 
<br> - Graphics cannot be produced 
<br> - Some graphics are produced but others are not 
<br>
<br>Possible causes :
<br>------------------------------------------------------
<br>1 - .py files are not executable
<br>
<br>2 - Server does not allow cgi script execution
<br>
<br>3 - Permissions is not given to write graphics to the disk.
<br>
<br>4 - Cgi message exchange has been corrupted by coding problems.
<br>
<br>
<br>Recovery procedure:
<br>-----------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>
<br>Remedy to cause 1 :
<br>----------------------------
<br>
<br>    1 - ssh username@machineHostingWebInterface
<br>    
<br>    2 - go into the filder where the web interface has been installed 
<br>        ex : /web/pxStats/
<br>    
<br>    3 - go into the scripts/cgi-bin folder. Make sure all the files 
<br>        found there are executable.
<br>
<br>Remedy to cause 2 :
<br>-----------------------------
<br>    1 - ssh username@machineHostingWebInterface
<br>    2 - go to the  /etc/apache2/sites-available
<br>    3 - open up the appropriate file
<br>    4 - make sure a section similar to this one is present : 
<br>     ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /web/pxStats/scripts/cgi-bin/
<br>     <Directory "/web/pxStats/scripts/cgi-bin/">
<br>              AllowOverride None
<br>              Options ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
<br>              Order allow,deny
<br>               Allow from all
<br>      </Directory>
<br>
<br>
<br>Remedy to cause 3 :
<br>-----------------------------
<br>1- ssh username@machineHostingWebInterface
<br>
<br>
<br>2- if an english installation has been made 
<br>   go to the ...pxStats/data/graphics/others/ folder.
<br>   Make sure all the folders found under this 
<br>   path(rrd and gnuplot ) and the ones under these
<br>   ( they will be sporting the clients and sources names )
<br>   give away the "write" permission to the web user.
<br>
<br>3- if a french install has been made, go to the
<br>    ...pxStats/donnees/graphiques/autres
<br>   Make sure all the folders found under this 
<br>   path(rrd and gnuplot ) and the ones under these
<br>   ( they will be sporting the clients and sources names )
<br>   give away the "write" permission to the web user.
<br>
<br>Remedy to cause 4:
<br>-------------------------------
<br>Note : This problem is usually encountered when new file versions 
<br>       are introduced into the files being used by the web interface.
<br>
<br>       Correcting this bug will require modifying a few lines of code.
<br>
<br>1 - ssh username@machineHostingWebInterface
<br>
<br>2 - go to the /var/log/apache2 folder
<br>
<br>3 - execute this command tail -f pxstats_access_log
<br>
<br>4 - go to the web interface and execute a query that is giving you problems.
<br>
<br>5 - watch the new lines being outputted by the  tail -f command.
<br>
<br>6 - copy the query  line which includes a calls to graphicsrequestbroker
<br>    which has jsut been added. this is the call you've just made
<br>
<br>    example : 
<br>    /scripts/cgi-bin/graphicsRequestBroker.py?querier=escape(%22graphicsRequestPage.py%22)&endTime=21-05-2008%2014%3A29%3A01&span=&fileType=tx&machines=pxatx&statsTypes=latence%2CnbreDeBytes%2CnbreDeFichiers%2Cerreurs&preDeterminedSpan=annuel&fixedSpan=Derniers%20365%20jours.&sourLients=ncp&combineSourlients=false&products=&lang=fr
<br>
<br>7 - go to the place where the web interface is installed
<br>    example :  /web/pxStats/script/cgi-bin/
<br>
<br>
<br>8 - execute your copied query this way :
<br>    .graphicsRequestBroker.py "?querier=escape(%22graphicsRequestPage.py%22)&endTime=21-05-2008%2014%3A29%3A01&span=&fileType=tx&machines=pxatx&statsTypes=latence%2CnbreDeBytes%2CnbreDeFichiers%2Cerreurs&preDeterminedSpan=annuel&fixedSpan=Derniers%20365%20jours.&sourLients=ncp&combineSourlients=false&products=&lang=fr"
<br>    
<br>    Note do not forget to leave a space between program name and parameters, and to wrap them with double quotes.
<br>
<br>9 - look out for any printout which do no start with 
<br>
<br>        HTTP/1.0 200 OK
<br>        Server: NCSA/1.0a6
<br>        Content-type: text/plain
<br>
<br>    for example the exepected reply to you query would be :
<br>
<br>        HTTP/1.0 200 OK
<br>        Server: NCSA/1.0a6
<br>        Content-type: text/plain
<br>
<br>        images=../../pxStats/donnees/graphiques/autres/rrd/ncp/tx_ncp_20080521_14:29:01_latence_1annees_sur_pxatx.png+../../pxStats/donnees/graphiques/autres/rrd/ncp/tx_ncp_20080521_14:29:01_nbreDeBytes_1annees_sur_pxatx.png+../../pxStats/donnees/graphiques/autres/rrd/ncp/tx_ncp_20080521_14:29:01_nbreDeFichiers_1annees_sur_pxatx.png+../../pxStats/donnees/graphiques/autres/rrd/ncp/tx_ncp_20080521_14:29:01_erreurs_1annees_sur_pxatx.png;error=
<br>
<br>    If anything else is printed above the header this will corrupt communications between the queried script and the querier.
<br>    Investigate queried scripts( graphicsRequestBroker.py,  GnuQueryBroker.py, GnuPlotter.py,  RRDGraphicProducer.py,  RRDQueryBroker.py, GraphicsQueryBrokerInterface.py, StatsPaths,StatsDateLib etc  ) and find which onhe is doing debugging priting.

<br>Section 5 Web interface problem
<br>----------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>Symptoms( any of these ) :
<br>----------------------------------------------------------
<br>    - None of the web page are being displayed.
<br>
<br>Possible causes :
<br>------------------------------------------------------
<br>- Url is wrong or has been changed or dns does not
<br>  recognise it.
<br>- Apache server problem 
<br>
<br>
<br>Solutions
<br>----------------------------------------------------------
<br>Verify both cause with the apache server administrator.
<br>
