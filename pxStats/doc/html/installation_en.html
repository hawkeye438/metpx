<br>        
<br>        Section 1.1.1 Software Requirements
<br>        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>            
<br>            Software requirement for execution.
<br>
<br>                Python     : version 2.3 or greater.
<br>                SSH        : Allows to connect and tranfer data /to/from other machines.
<br>                Rsync      : Allows to synchronise data between machines.
<br>                RRDTOOL    : Time-series storage and display system.
<br>                Python-rrd : Python package.
<br>                Gnuplot.py : Python package.
<br>                Sundew     : Python package which is part of the MetPX project.
<br>
<br>            If maintenance and or developpement is to be done the following 
<br>            software will be required :
<br>
<br>                pygettext : Allows to get .pot files from .py files.
<br>                msgfmt    : Transforms .pot files into binary files readable by
<br>                            pythons gettext module.
<br>
<br>            
<br>        Section 1.1.2 Hardware Requirements
<br>        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>            
<br>            
<br>            -> Some parts of the software were developped with a multi-processor 
<br>               machine architecture in mind. Perfomances will take a hit if program 
<br>               is run on a single processor machine.    
<br>
<br>            -> On average, under the current clients/sources configuration of metx 
<br>               each client/source requires on the average 50 megs for it's 
<br>               log files. Currently, 24 gigs are requried to house the files 
<br>               of the 482 clients/sources which are spread on different machines.
<br>            
<br>               This space will be needed under ...pxstats/data/logFiles/
<br>              ( or pxStats/donnees/fichiersJournalisation for a french install )
<br>               if pickling is not done on the machine where orgininal logs reside.
<br>                 
<br>                This  machine can be an independant machine between the graphic
<br>                producing machine and the log producing machine or the graphic
<br>                producing machine itself.
<br>                
<br>                
<br>            -> At least 6gb of disk space for graphics. Current cleaner configuration
<br>               and number of graphics, combined with the current number of 
<br>               client/sources keeps the space used under 1gb. That number could grow
<br>               indefinatly based on cleaner settings and a growing number of
<br>               client/sources.
<br>               
<br>               NOTE : The cleaner DOES NOT currently clean archives at all, meaning 
<br>                      archives could be kept forever.
<br>            
<br>            
<br>                This space will be needed under ...pxstats/data/graphics/
<br>                or ...pxStats/donnees/graphiques/
<br>
<br>            
<br>            
<br>             -> At least 800 megs of disk space for the current databases( 1.61 megs per client ).
<br>                Right now the different databases take up 250 megs but a different 
<br>                consolidation configuration or a growing number of client/sources 
<br>                could make this number climb up greatly.
<br>                
<br>                This space will be needed under ...pxstats/data/databases/currentDatabases
<br>                or .../pxStats/donnees/basesDeDonnees/basesDeDonneesCourantes 
<br>                    
<br>             -> At least 15gb of disk space for database backups. We currently keep 20
<br>                backups(at ~< 800 megs each) saved at every 12 hours, wich gives us 
<br>                access to the saved data of the past 10 days. Saving every 12 hours helps 
<br>                us keep a limited number of backups while keeping the gap between backups
<br>                small enough to hopefully keep data recevery times low.
<br>                
<br>                This space will be needed under .../pxStats/data/databases/databasesBackups
<br>                or ...pxStats/donnees/basesDeDonnees/basesDeDonneesEmmagasinees
<br>            
<br>                
<br>            -> At least 100 gb of disk space if you want to keep the pickles.
<br>               Currently we are averaging a 8 megs per client per days of pickles kept.
<br>               We recommend keeping pickle backups for as long as databsee backups are kept.
<br>               If not the source data pickles will no longer be available if an error is 
<br>               introduced within the databases but was not present within the pickles. 
<br>               
<br>               This space will be needed under ../pxStats/data/pickles/
<br>               or .../pxStats/donnees/pickles
<br>
<br>               WARNING : KEEPING pickles for too short a period will cause serious problems.

<br>            Section 2.2.1.1 Notes on the update frequencies in this file.
<br>            ------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<br>                2.2.1.1.1 pxStatsFrequency
<br>                -------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>                    Ideally, this should be run hourly. At the very least, it should be at 
<br>                    as frequently as the artifact that is to be updated the most frequently.
<br>
<br>                2.2.1.1.2 monitoringFrequency
<br>                -------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>                    Monitoring should doest not need to be done at every hour. Anyways
<br>                    this would send out to many emails to the administrator dimishing the 
<br>                    chances of them being read.
<br>
<br>                2.2.1.1.3 dbBackupsFrequency
<br>                -------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>                    Backups should be made quite frequently as to shorten data 
<br>                    recuperation in case of data curruption. However backing up too 
<br>                    frequentlywill jack up disk usage if backups are to be kept for any
<br>                    significant amount of time.
<br>
<br>                2.2.1.1.4 pickleCleanerFrequency
<br>                -------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>                    Since the pickles to keep is measured in days, running this daily
<br>                    is optimal.
<br>
<br>                2.2.1.1.5 generalCleanerFrequency
<br>                -------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>                    Update frequnecy found here should be based on what will be found in the 
<br>                    clean_dir.conf file.
<br>
<br>                2.2.1.1.6 xWebPageUpdatesFrequency
<br>                -------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>                    NOTES: The update frequency of web pages listed here will influence 
<br>                           the update frequency of the artifacts lsited on these web pages.
<br>
<br>                        -> dailyWebPageUpdatesFrequency
<br>                          Since columbo users are expecting graphics to be updated hourly,
<br>                          this should also be update hourly.
<br>    
<br>                        -> weeklyWebPageUpdatesFrequency
<br>                           This could be updated daily or hourly if visualizing the 
<br>                           progression of the week is desired. Otherwise it cold be update weekly.
<br>                           More infrequently than that would make little sens.
<br>
<br>                        -> monthlyWebPageUpdatesFrequency
<br>                           Updating hourly is probably useless and will only add up to machine load.
<br>                           If weeklies are updated frequently, hgaving these graphics updated once
<br>                           per week seems optimal.
<br>
<br>                        -> yearlyWebPageUpdatesFrequency
<br>                           Like the monthly graphics, this should not be updated too often.
<br>                           These are currently update monthly and this seem sufficiant.
<br>
<br>                       -> totalWebPageUpdatesFrequency
<br>                           Since they include all graphic types from daily to yearly,
<br>                           this should be updated as frequently as the most frequently
<br>                           updated web page.

<br>                    ---------------------------------------------------------------        
<br>                    -> The only graphics wich should be cleaned up on a regular basis 
<br>                       are the ones found under .../pxstats/data/graphics/others or 
<br>                       .../pxStats/donnees/graphiques/autres
<br> 
<br>                    -> Graphics in the other section should be kept since they are 
<br>                       part of those to be used within columbo's interface or
<br>                       within the web archives.

<br>
<br>
<br>         Section 2.3 Setting up ssh
<br>        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>            When setting up the config file in the .../pxstats/etc/ folder
<br>            ( section 2.2.1 ) you can set up things so that different machine do 
<br>            different tasks. 
<br>            
<br>            For example, things can be set up so that a central machine(x) creates the
<br>            graphics, calls another machine(y) to do the pickling of data, wich in turn
<br>            calls another machine(z) to get the log files it needs. That would actually 
<br>            be the worst case scenario on the machine interconnectability scale.  
<br>            
<br>            To make sure everything works smoothly you need to set up
<br>            ssh connections between the machines wich have a dependance in a way 
<br>            that an ssh connection can be made using the client name specified 
<br>            in the config file WITHOUT having to enter a password.       
<br>                            
<br>        
<br>        Section 2.4 Setting up Crontabs      
<br>        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>            Here is a sample of a crontab file that's currently being run on 
<br>            a development machine :
<br>        
<br>            2  * * * * /apps/px/pxStats/bin/pxStatsStartup.py  > /dev/null 2>&1
<br>    
<br>            To obtain the listing of all the entries in the crontab of the machine 
<br>            you are setting up, type crontab -l.
<br>            
<br>            To edit this list, type crontab -e.
<br>

<br>            Should run hourly. Choice of minute at wich it starts is arbitrary 
<br>            but it should be run at the top of the hour so that tasks have the time 
<br>            to end prior to the start of the following hour so that hourly graphics

<br>
<br>    Section 3: Installing as a second machine(or more) or as a mirror machine.
<br>    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>        This section covers the different aspects that need to be covered to start up 
<br>        (or restart) a machine when another machine is currently producing graphics 
<br>        for the same machine as the one you want to start up.  
<br>    
<br>        
<br>        Section 3.1 What needs to be set up.    
<br>        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>            With such a machine, all the configuration files and the crontabs that 
<br>            are needed to be configured in a first machine still need to be 
<br>            configured.
<br>            
<br>            If a different set up is to be used( example remotely generated pickles 
<br>            vs locally generated pickles ) of if not all of the source machine will 
<br>            be handled by the two machines, a manual set up(section 3.1.1) is
<br>            required.
<br>            
<br>            Otherwise when the new machine will have the exact same behavior as the 
<br>            mirrored machine, a transfer of settings(section 3.1.2) should be done. 
<br>            
<br>            3.1.1 Settings things up manually.
<br>            -------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>                Step 1 -> Open a console session to the allready running machine.
<br>                Step 2 -> Open a console session to the new machine. 
<br>                Step 3 -> Follow step 2.2 to 2.5 of this document.
<br>                Step 4 -> Copy all the parameters that seem usefull from the mirrored
<br>                        machine into the settings you are configuring on the new 
<br>                        machine.
<br>                Step 5 -> Add/modify/remove any parameters that is different from 
<br>                        the mirror machine.          
<br>                
<br>            3.1.2 Downloading remote parameters.
<br>            -------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>                -> To have the exact same configuration files as a remote machine
<br>                you need to execute the following commands.
<br>                
<br>                scp -r login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/etc/* .../pxStats/etc/
<br>                
<br>                -> Some settings cannot be downloaded. The crontab entries 
<br>                of the remote machine will need to be copied on the local machine.
<br>                
<br>                -> Step 2.3 setting up ssh will also need to be done ion the exact 
<br>                same fashion as the mirrored machine on the local machine.  
<br>                
<br>        
<br>        Section 3.2 What needs to be downloaded.
<br>                (Also usefull when restarting a machine)    
<br>        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br>            
<br>            3.2.1 On a mirror machine
<br>            -------------------------------------------------------------------------  
<br>                On a mirror machine a small utility allready exists wich will transfer
<br>                all the monitoring artifacts, pickles, graphs, databases, backups from 
<br>                one machine to another one.
<br>                
<br>                To use this utility use the following command : 
<br>                python .../pxStats/bin/tools/retreiveDataFromMachine.py login remoteMachineName
<br>                
<br>                Please read warning on this utility prior to running it.
<br>                run this utility PRIOR to running any crontab entries( pxStatsStartup.py )
<br>                
<br>                If for any reasons a long delay is to occur between the execution 
<br>                of this utility, and the first execution of the crontabs, rerun the
<br>                utility to make sure you have all the latest version of the different
<br>                files.  
<br>                
<br>                Note : ...pxStats/etc/config needs to be configured PRIOR to calling 
<br>                       retreiveDataFromMachine.py. 
<br>                        
<br>                    ssh permissions also need to be set as to permit connection
<br>                    between local machine and mirrored machine without being asked
<br>                    for a password.
<br>            
<br>                
<br>            3.2.1 On a non-mirror machine
<br>            -------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>                On a non mirror machine getting the files you require might prove to 
<br>                be a bit tricky...
<br>                
<br>                Here is a way to get all the type of files you need.
<br>                
<br>                Note : Make sure you have enough disk space before attempting to 
<br>                download all these files. Total disk space used can be considerable.
<br>                
<br>                3.2.1.1 Transferring log files :
<br>                ---------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>                You should only download the the log files of a particular machine 
<br>                if the local machine will be the one producing the pickles for that
<br>                particular machine.
<br>                
<br>                The command to use is this one :
<br>                rsync -avzr --delete-before -e ssh login@logProducingMachine:/apps/px/log/ 
<br>                .../pxStats/data/logFiles/logProducingMachine/ 
<br>                
<br>                3.2.1.2 Transferring monitoring artifacts :
<br>                ---------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>                
<br>                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh 
<br>                login@remoteMachine:/.../pxStats/data/monitoring/maxSettings.conf
<br>                .../pxStats/data/monitoring/maxSettings.conf
<br>    
<br>                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh 
<br>                login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/data/monitoring/maxSettings.confpreviousCrontab
<br>                .../pxStats/data/monitoring/maxSettings.confpreviousCrontab
<br>    
<br>                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh 
<br>                login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/data/monitoring/maxSettings.confpreviousFileChecksums
<br>                .../pxStats/data/monitoring/maxSettings.confpreviousFileChecksums
<br>    
<br>                
<br>                3.2.1.2 Transferring graphics :
<br>                ---------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>            
<br>                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/data/graphics/
<br>                .../pxStats/data/graphics/
<br>                
<br>                Note : If the current machine does not handle all of the machines that
<br>                the source machine handles, you will be downloading some useless files.
<br>                Never the less, if disk space allows it, it will be much easier to 
<br>                download all the graphs instead of finding only the required ones. 
<br>                
<br>                3.2.1.2 Transferring pickles :
<br>                ---------------------------------------------------------------------                        
<br>                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/data/pickles/ 
<br>                .../pxStats/data/pickles/ 
<br>                
<br>                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/data/picklesTimeOfUpdates/ 
<br>                .../pxStats/data/picklesTimeOfUpdates/
<br>
<br>
<br>                3.2.1.2 Transferring databases :
<br>                ---------------------------------------------------------------------                              
<br>                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh 
<br>                login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/data/databases/ 
<br>                .../pxStats/data/databases/ 
<br>
<br>                Transferring a huge amount of file might take a few hours.
<br>                This means that the first type of filed(ex : pickles ) will be 
<br>                missing some files by the time you finish to download the last type 
<br>                of files(ex : databases). This might cause inconstancy.
<br>
<br>                To overcome this, run the commands in a specific sequence numerous times.
<br>                After a few times no new data will be present(except maybe for log files 
<br>                wich will not be a problem). This can be seen by analysing the output 
<br>                produced by the different rsync commands you have decided to run.

<br>
<br>    Section 4 : Setting up a remote machine for pickling.
<br>    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>    
<br>        A remote machine used only for pickling will need the following :
<br>        
<br>        4.1 Required Files
<br>        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    
<br>            -> All the found under the /apps/px/lib/stats/ folder 
<br>            wich can be downloaded here 
<br>            https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/metpx/trunk/sundew/lib/stats/  
<br>                
<br>            -> Logger.py   : usually found under /apps/px/lib/
<br>                                
<br>            -> PXPaths.py  : usually found under /apps/px/lib/
<br>            
<br>            -> PXManager   : usually found under /apps/px/lib/
<br>            
<br>            All of wich can be downloaded here : 
<br>            https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/metpx/trunk/sundew/lib/ 
<br>    
<br>            
<br>        4.2 Required disk space
<br>        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>            Depending on the number of handled machine, required disk space will vary
<br>            greatly. Consult section 1.1.2 for details.
<br>        
<br>            
<br>        4.3 Setting up ssh
<br>        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
<br>            SSH will minimally need to be set up so that the machine generating the 
<br>            graphics will be able to call the pickle generating machine without 
<br>            asking the user to enter a password.
<br>                
<br>            If the pickle generating machine is not the one producing the log files
<br>            it will also need a similar set up between itself and the log producing 
<br>            machine.
