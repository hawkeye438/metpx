<br>        Quick overview( Taken from official web page )
<br>        -----------------------------------------------------
<br>        
<br>        * RRDtool stores data; that makes it a back-end tool. The RRDtool command set 
<br>        allows thecreation of graphs; that makes it a front-end tool as well. 
<br>        Other databases just store data and can not create graphs.
<br>        
<br>        * In case of linear databases, new data gets appended at the bottom of the
<br>        database table. Thus its size keeps on increasing, whereas the size of an 
<br>        RRDtool database is determined at creation time. Imagine an RRDtool database 
<br>        as the perimeter of a circle. Data is added along the perimeter. When new 
<br>        data reaches the starting point, it overwrites existing data. This way, the 
<br>        size of an RRDtool database always remains constant. The name ``Round Robin''
<br>        stems from this behavior.
<br>        
<br>        
<br>        Creating the database :
<br>        ------------------------------------------------------  
<br>            rrdtool.create( databaseName, '--start','%s' %( startTime ), '--step',
<br>            '60','DS:latency:GAUGE:60:U:U', 'RRA:AVERAGE:0:1:1440',
<br>            'RRA:MIN:0:1:1440', 'RRA:MAX:0:1:1440', 'RRA:AVERAGE:0:5:2016',
<br>            'RRA:MIN:0:5:2016', 'RRA:MAX:0:5:2016','RRA:AVERAGE:0:1440:3650',
<br>            'RRA:MIN:0:1440:3650', 'RRA:MAX:0:1440:3650' ) 
<br>            
<br>        This creates a database named databaseName, wich starts at startTime. 
<br>        No data that has a date prior or equal to startTime will be accepted.
<br>        
<br>        Step allows to specify the frequency (in seconds) at wich data will be fed to 
<br>        the database.    
<br>        
<br>        DS(data source) specifies the name of the data we want to save in the database. 
<br>        GAUGE is the type of calculation that is to be used( choices are GAUGE, COUNTER,
<br>        DERIVE, ABSOLUTE)
<br>        
<br>        60 is the maximum amount of time for wich we will accept no data
<br>        to be entered. If there is more than 60 secs between updates, values of non 
<br>        filled entries will be set to unknown.
<br>        
<br>        :u:u specifies that both minimum and maximum acepted values are unlimited.
<br>        
<br>        
<br>        RRA's allows us to specify how data is to be consolidated inthe database.
<br>        1st set of rra's : keep last 24 hours for daily graphs. Each line contains 
<br>                        1 minute of data. 
<br>                        ( 1440 * 1 entry of 60 seconds) 
<br>        2nd set of rra's : keep last 7 days for weekly graphs. Each line contains 
<br>                        5 minutes of data. 
<br>                        ( 2016 * 5 combined entries of 60 seconds each )
<br>        3rd set of rra's : keep last 10 years of data. Each line contains 24 hours 
<br>                        of data.
<br>                        ( 3650 * 1440 combined entries of 60 seconds each. )
<br>            
<br>                        
<br>        For each rra's, the 0 value means that 0% of unknown data is allowed for each 
<br>        entry. In current program settings this value has been set to 0.5 as to allow
<br>        some hours to have a few minutes with empty data,especially the very first hour
<br>        where the database was created since rrd doesnt allow to update the very first 
<br>        minute of that hour. This behaviour causes an RRA witha setting of 0% to 
<br>        discard an entire day of data based on a single minute of empty data.
<br>        
<br>                                        
<br>        Important note on database creation.
<br>        --------------------------------------------------------
<br>        RRA's behave on relative values, not absolutes. This means that if a database
<br>        is created using a starting time of 13:16:56 and you specify an AVERAGE rra
<br>        containing one hours worth of data, your first entry will be filled with data 
<br>        comprised between 13:16:56 and 14:16:56 NOT between 13:16:56 and 14:00:00. While
<br>        this does save the data in 1 hour wide entries, this will  make for most 
<br>        applications therefore it is recommended to start up databases at the closest
<br>        point of the furthest entry that is to be used.
<br>        
<br>        Examples : hourly entries needs the database to start at the top of the hour.    
<br>                daily entries need to start at the very start of the day. 
<br>                Yearly entries would probably need to start at the beginning of 
<br>                the month.
<br>                ( Handling monthly and yearly data is ackward and would probably 
<br>                    require a few workarounds. )
<br>                                    
<br>                                            
<br>        Feeding the database with data :
<br>        ------------------------------------------------------
<br>        The following command must be executed to update the database names 
<br>        databaseName. 
<br>        
<br>        rrdtool.update( rrdFileName, '%s:%s' %( int(pair[0]), int(pair[1]) ) )
<br>        
<br>        First value of the pair is the number of seconds since epoch value for wich 
<br>        we want to set a value.
<br>        
<br>        Number of seconds must be an integer.    
<br>        
<br>        Second value is the value to be set.                 
<br>                        
<br>        Data must be added in chronological order. Data can never be set for dates 
<br>        prior or equal to the one of the most recent update. Because of that, first 
<br>        update must have a number of seconds higher than the one of the date of creation
<br>        of the database.
<br>        
<br>        
<br>        Important note on database updating technique.
<br>        ------------------------------------------------------
<br>        RRD databases do not work like gnuplot. Pairs fed to the database must not be
<br>        exactly like gnuplot pairs or else the end result will be erronous. 
<br>        
<br>        With gnuplot feeding the pairs(1,10) and (2,25) would resultin the value 10 
<br>        being drawn between 1 and 2  and 25 being drawn between 2 and 3. 
<br>        
<br>        With rrd, the opposite will happen. If you feed the database with the pairs
<br>        (1,10) and (2,25)this will draw the value 10 between 0 and 1 and draw 25 
<br>        between 1 and 2.
<br>        
<br>        Make sure you understand this prior to feeding the database or else your 
<br>        entire set of data will be corrupted. 
<br>        
<br>        
<br>        Note on data accuracy.
<br>        -----------------------------------------------------
<br>        When using the AVERAGE consolidation function(CF), data will be consolidated 
<br>        into a single point based on the average of all the points used.
<br>        
<br>        While transferring data points into an average and then adding up that average
<br>        to make another data point in combined databases we have found that some data 
<br>        accuracy was lost.
<br>        
<br>        In one example where all the data fed was verified as being exact, the rounding
<br>        of the first point combined with the rounding of the sum of all those rounded 
<br>        points transformed an expected sum of 7348 into 7344. 
<br>        
<br>        4/7348 = 0.0005 wich means that approximatly .05% of data accuracy being lost.    
<br>        
<br>        
<br>        
<br>        Generating Graphs
<br>        ------------------------------------------------------
<br>        rrdtool.graph( imageName,'--imgformat', 'PNG','--width', '600','--height', 
<br>        '200','--start', "%i" %(start) ,'--end', "%s" %(end), '--vertical-label', '%s' 
<br>        %type,'--title', '%s'%title,'COMMENT: Minimum %s Maximum  %s Mean %.2f\c' 
<br>        %( minimum, maximum, mean), '--lower-limit','0',
<br>        'DEF:latency=%s:latency:AVERAGE'%databaseName,
<br>        'AREA:latency#cd5c5c:%s' %type,'LINE1:latency#8b0000:%s'%type)
<br>        
<br>        - Will create an image named imageName of the specified width and height.
<br>        - Start and End must be expressed in seconds since epoch. Integer value only,
<br>        no float will be accepted.
<br>        - Label, comments and title speak for themselves. 
<br>        - 'DEF:latency=%s:latency:AVERAGE'%databaseName means to get data from the 
<br>        AVERAGE RRA coming from database named databaseName and to store it in a
<br>        variable named latency. 
<br>        - Fetched data in preceding line will be comprised between start and end.
<br>        - 'AREA:latency#cd5c5c:%s' %type means to draw an area style graph with the
<br>        data found in the variable named latency.
<br>        - 'LINE1:latency#8b0000:%s'%type means to draw a line1 style graph with the
<br>        data found in the variable named latency.
<br>        - The above plots the same data twice. However having a line contour the area
<br>        graph makes graphs looks much better.
<br>        - In both cases the #xxxxxx number helps specify the color of the graph.
<br>        
<br>                        
<br>        Database size :
<br>        ------------------------------------------------------
<br>        Database size, since it will never gow, has been found very acceptable. 
<br>        
<br>        Current testing configuration has us transfer all the pickled data from both 
<br>        rx and tx clients from machines called pxatx, pds5 and pds6. This means around
<br>        135 sources/clients. Tx clients have 5 databases each.Rx sources only have 3.
<br>        All dabatases are made to be fed with data that is split by the minute.
<br>        
<br>        In each database, we currently keep the data archived in this fashion : 
<br>        1- The mean,max and min of every minute saved up to the last 5 days.
<br>        2- The mean,max and min of every hour minutes saved up to the last 14 days.
<br>        3- The mean,max and min of every day saved up to the last 10 years.
<br>        
<br>        All this takes up around 180 megs on the disk.
