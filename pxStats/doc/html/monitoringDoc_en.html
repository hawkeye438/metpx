<br>    About
<br>    ---------------------
<br>    This utility was created as as to limit user interaction with the library
<br>    to the bare minimum. Therefore it monitors most of the vital
<br>    aspects of the library so that the user does not have to. Monitoring 
<br>    is to be made on a frequent interval and results are mailed to the 
<br>    library's administrator. Actions can then be taken to correct the errors
<br>    using the utilities found in the library. See the TROUBLESHOOTING section
<br>    for details.    
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    What's monitored
<br>    ----------------------
<br>    Disk usage : Disk usage is monitored for each of the folders
<br>                in wich the library writes data. A warning will be raised 
<br>                if disk usage % goes over the amount specified in the config file or if
<br>                the specified path does not exist.  
<br>    
<br>        
<br>    Missing pickle files : Machines are supposed to keep the pickle files for at 
<br>                        least 7 days. The stats monitor thus checks 
<br>                        if the pickles for the clients/sources of all the specified
<br>                        machines  are all present for the past 7 days. If files are 
<br>                        missing a warning will be written in the report.
<br>        
<br>    Data gap             : Verifies all the pickle files to see if any data gaps deemed 
<br>                        too wide are found. If the gap between two transmissions has
<br>                        been logged in the Columbo interface it will be considered
<br>                        normal and will be discarted. Otherwise a warning in the
<br>                        report will be added describing the anomaly found.
<br>                            
<br>    Stats log files      : Log files produced during the hourly activities of the stats
<br>                        library are monitored to see if activity has occured every
<br>                        hour. If more than an hour has gone by without any activity
<br>                        occuring, it will be reported.        
<br>    
<br>    Library files        : Checksums will be run at every monitoring job and the 
<br>                        current checksum will be compared to the previous checksum.
<br>                        If the checksum for a file within the library has been 
<br>                        modified it will be reported. This is done in case a newer
<br>                        or older version of a file is being installed and that it
<br>                        is not compatible with the current version of the library.
<br>                                            
<br>    Crontab entries      : This saves the current crontab listing every time a 
<br>                        monitoring job is made. If current crontab listing is 
<br>                        different than the previous crontab a warning will be added
<br>                        to the report.
<br>    
<br>    WebPages             : Checks if the web pages have been updated at the right
<br>                        interval. Adds a warning to the report if webpages seem
<br>                        outdated.
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    Configuring the stats library monitor
<br>    ---------------------------------------
<br>    1 - Open the /apps/px/stats/statsMonitoring/statsMonitoring.conf configuration file.
<br>    
<br>    2 - Follow instructions.
<br>    
<br>    Here is an example of a config file currently being used on a machine named logan1

<br>    ## Author : Nicholas Lemay  
<br>    ##
<br>    ## Date   : December 1st 2006
<br>    ##
<br>    ## Goal   : This config file is to be read by statsMonitoring.py from the stats library.    
<br>    ##
<br>    ##          config file must contain only valid parameters or else statsMonitoring will
<br>    ##          not work.
<br>    ##
<br>    ## Usage  : When using a list of parameters, parameters must be seperated by the ';' 
<br>    ##          character. When a single parameter is a list in itself, seperate items  
<br>    ##          with the ',' character. Paths need to be absolute path names.
<br>    ##
<br>    ##
<br>    ## Parameters: emails : Speficies the recipients to wich the results of the monitoring 
<br>    ##                      will be forwarded          
<br>    ##
<br>    ##             machines : Specifies the machines for wich this machine is currently 
<br>    ##                        producing graphics for. If paired data is used 
<br>    ##                        (ex machine1,machine2) machines must be seperated with the
<br>    ##                        ',' character Ex: pds5,pds6;pxatx
<br>    ##
<br>    ##             files    : List of files used by the stats library. statsMonitoring
<br>    ##                        monitors the version fo these files and warns user if they 
<br>    ##                        were changed since the last monitoring job occured. 
<br>    ##
<br>    ##             folders  : List of all folders used by the stats library. statsMonitoring 
<br>    ##                        will monitor disk usage for all these folder to make sure 
<br>    ##                        they do not go over a specified limit. If it does report sent to 
<br>    ##                        user will have a mention of excessive disk usage.
<br>    ##              
<br>    ##             maxusage:  Specifies the maximum disk usage allowed for each of the 
<br>    ##                        specified folders. Important note : The number of arameters used
<br>    ##                        here must be the exact same number of parameters used in the
<br>    ##                        folders parameters.  
<br>    ##
<br>    ##             errorsLogFile : Specify where the log file containing all the detected
<br>    ##                             px errors were detected in the columbo interface.
<br>    ##
<br>    ##             maxSettingsFile : Specify where the config file containing the maximum 
<br>    ##                               timer values are set.

<br>    
<br>    Troubleshooting procedures:
<br>    ---------------------------------
<br>    
<br>    1- Disk usage warnings
<br>    ----------------------------------
<br>    Definition : Disk usage errors can either be cause by missing folders or by a disk usage 
<br>    percentage above allowed percentage. 
<br>    
<br>    Solutions : 
<br>    Case 1 - Folder is missing
<br>        Step 1 : Verify if it is requiered. 
<br>        Step 2 : If it is not remove it from the folders section of the config file.
<br>        Step 3 : If it is verify why it is missing.
<br>    
<br>    Case 2 - Disk usage is too high.
<br>        Step 1 : Verify the config file to see the value of max usage.
<br>        Step 2 : If max usage allowed is set to a value too low set it to an higher value.
<br>        Step 3 : If max usage allowed is set properly verify if the cleaner, 
<br>                (/apps/px/etc/clean.conf) is set properly to clean your directory 
<br>                and if it is run frequently by crontab.(Run crontab -l to see the list of entries.)
<br>        Step 4 : If all is set properly and the requiered files take up too much space,
<br>                relocate files or add disk space...              
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    2- Missing pickle files
<br>    ----------------------------------
<br>    Definition : The monitor expects all pickles files to be present 
<br>                for all machines for the past 7 days. Is some files are missing 
<br>                warnings will show up in the emails.
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    Case 1 - Files are missing on a new installation of the stats library.
<br>    
<br>            Step 1 - Verify if missing files reported only come from 
<br>                    the time prior to the installation of the library. 
<br>            Step 2 - If they don't go to case 3
<br>            Step 3 - If they do, and another machine was allready running the stats library,
<br>                    installation of the stats library was not done properly.
<br>                    Refer to the installation file of the doc folder for the proper procedure.             
<br>    
<br>    Case 2 - Files are missing and the reported source/client is new.
<br>    
<br>            Step 1 - Verify if missing files reported only come from 
<br>                    the time prior to the initialisation of the new client/source. 
<br>            Step 2 - If they don't go to case 3
<br>            
<br>    
<br>    Case 3 - Files are missing on running client/source.
<br>    
<br>            Step 1 - Verify if cleaner( /apps/px/etc/clean.conf ) is configured properly. 
<br>                    If is is configured to keep too few of the files,
<br>                    warnings will show up in the reports.
<br>            Step 2 - If cleaner is configured properly, investigate what might cause the problem
<br>                    - Stopped crontab entries ( see 6- Crontab entries were modified ) 
<br>                    - Manual deletion by another user.
<br>            Step 3 - If all else fails, contact developer.                              
<br>                        
<br>    
<br>                            
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    3- Data gaps found
<br>    ----------------------------------
<br>    Definition : Data gaps are found within pickle files and represents gaps of times
<br>                where no data was present in a client's pickles. 
<br>                
<br>                Gaps are often found to be normal since there was actually no data for a 
<br>                certain period of time. To make sure there was no data, gaps are compared 
<br>                to the gaps listed in Columbo's error logs.  
<br>                
<br>                If data gaps are found in the emailed reports, it means that it should no be 
<br>                present in the pickle files.
<br>            
<br>                Errors found here are usually code-related and troublesome to fix by 
<br>                a third-party. Nonetheless here is the standard procedure to spot the 
<br>                cause of the problem. Contact developer if problem remains.
<br>                    
<br>    Solution :
<br>                
<br>    Step 1 : Verify the guilty pickle to see if data really is missing during that time.
<br>            to do so run  pickleViewer.py pathToThePickle wich can be found within the 
<br>            /apps/px/lib/stats/ folder. For details on how pickles are saved, consult
<br>            the developers doc.  
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    Case 1 - Pickle contains data within the specified gap.
<br>            (Problem probably resides within the statsMonitor.)
<br>        
<br>        Step 1 - Verify if statsMonitor.py was recetly modified
<br>                ( 5- Checksums warnings found )  
<br>        
<br>        Step 2 - If statsMonitor.py was recently modified, verify file
<br>                modification history to see what was modified
<br>                and if modifications seem like they might be responsible
<br>                for the problems. Install the older version fo the seemingly
<br>                problematic file to see if new bugs were introduced by
<br>                the new files.
<br>        
<br>        Step 3 - If statsMonitor.py was not recently modified, verify 
<br>                if the currently installed version of the monitor is the 
<br>                latest version found within the svn tree. If not, 
<br>                consult the update comments of that file and install what seems 
<br>                to be the latest stable version. 
<br>        
<br>        Step 4 - If problem persists after steps 2 or 4,
<br>                consult developer to see what is wrong with the monitor.
<br>        
<br>        
<br>                
<br>    Case 2 - Pickle does not contain data within the specified gap. 
<br>        
<br>        Step 1 - Verify if the following files ( FileStatsCollector.py, ClientStatsPickler.py,
<br>                DirectoryFileCollector.py, pickleUpdater.py, launchGraphCreation.py )
<br>                have recently been modified.
<br>                Verify this through the last few emails that were sent.
<br>                ( See 5- Checksums warnings found for details )         
<br>        
<br>        Step 2 - If they were, verify if data gap problems have appeared ever since one of the files 
<br>                was changed. If it does, verify file modification history to see what was modified
<br>                and if modifications seem like they might be responsible for the problems, install 
<br>                the file of an older version to see if new bugs were introduced by the new files.  
<br>        
<br>        Step 3 - If they were not, verify if the latest version of these files is installed.
<br>                If it is not, install the lastest version of these files.
<br>                
<br>        Step 4 - If problem persists after step 2 or 3, consult developer.           
<br>    
<br>            
<br>    
<br>    4- Log warnings found
<br>    ----------------------------------
<br>    Definition: For all types of log files generated by the stats library,
<br>                the monitor expects to find at least one entry per hour.
<br>    
<br>    Case 1 - No data is found within the specified log files
<br>            prior to the start of the reported problems.
<br>            
<br>            Case 1.1 - If all log files of the same name( x.log, x.log.1, x.log.2,etc)
<br>                        seem(content distribution isn't totally reliable...) to be full 
<br>                        of log entries, this probably means that either the size allocated
<br>                        to the log files is too small or that the number of lines produced
<br>                        by the different programs using this log file between two monitoring
<br>                        job is too big.  
<br>                    
<br>                    Step 1 - Ask developer to increase log size or decrease number of
<br>                            log lines.
<br>                    
<br>                    Step 2 - If size and number of line seem adequate, or cannot be changed,
<br>                            you could change increase the frequency of the monitoring jobs.             
<br>                    
<br>    Case 2 - Data is found within the specified log files
<br>            prior to the start of the reported problems.         
<br>    
<br>            This means data should be present within the log files for the reported hours.
<br>            
<br>            Step 1 - Verify if data production was halted during the reported period. 
<br>                    If it was, missing log entries are perfectly normal. 
<br>            
<br>            Step 2 - Verify if log producing files( transferPickleToRRD.py, generateRRDGRaphics.py,
<br>                    generateGraphics.py, StatsPickler.py) or the ones that use them were modified.                    
<br>                    If they were, reinstall the previous wroking version. 
<br>                    
<br>                    Note : To see the file interaction diagram, consult the developers doc.
<br>                    
<br>            Step 3 - If running an installation on a branch, verify if a newer version of the modified 
<br>                    files exists. If so, install it and see if it fixes the problem.
<br>                    
<br>            Step 4 - If all the above fail, contact developer.
<br>                    
<br>    
<br>    5- Checksums warnings found
<br>    ----------------------------------
<br>    
<br>    Definition : Modified checksums should not be viewed 
<br>    as a problem per se. It can be usefull to spot problems
<br>    wich could stem from someone modifying a file used by the program.
<br>    
<br>    Examples : 
<br>    
<br>    Case 1- Someone install a branch of the stats library containing 
<br>    files that are older than the newest version. This could cause some 
<br>    compatibility problems between the older and the newer files or 
<br>    bring back old bugs that have been corrected since. 
<br>    
<br>        Step 1 - Find the newest version of the problematic file through the svn trunk
<br>                and install it.
<br>    
<br>    Case 2- Someone introduces bugs by inserting a new version of a file 
<br>    wich was not properly tested.
<br>    
<br>        Step 2- Find the previous version of the file through the svn trunk and install it.
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    6- Crontab entries were modified
<br>    ----------------------------------
<br>    Modified crons should not be viewed as a problem per se.
<br>    It can be usefull to spot problems wich could stem from someone
<br>    the crons.
<br>    
<br>    Examples: 
<br>    1- All of the graphic production artifacts are missing for x hours.
<br>    This is a clear sign that the main cron has been stopped.
<br>    
<br>    2- Log files warnings are found.
<br>    
<br>    3- You don't receive the statsMonitoring email.
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    What to do: 
<br>    
<br>    Case 1-3
<br>    ---------
<br>        1- Connect to the problematic machine.
<br>        2- Verify crons under de "px" username by typing crontab -l 
<br>        3- Verify if crontab entry is still present of if a "#" character is present 
<br>        in front of the desired entry.
<br>        4- Find source who has modified the crons.
<br>        5- If everything is ok, return cron to operation by removing the # character or 
<br>        re-entring the entry.     
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    
<br>    7,8- Web pages were outdated/Graphics were outdated
<br>    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>    Description : Daily graphics and web pages are supposed to be updated hourly.
<br>    
<br>    Step 1 - Verify if graphic or web pages related files were recently modified.
<br>    
<br>    Step 2 - If they were, verify mails previous to the change to see if problems 
<br>            have started showing up only after the changes.
<br>        
<br>        Step 2.1 - If they did appear only after file was modified, reinstall the 
<br>                previous version of the file.
<br>        
<br>        Step 2.2 - Contact developer to notify of problems introduced by the newer
<br>                file.                    
<br>        
<br>    Step 3 - If they were not, check if a more recent version of the files exists.
<br>            If it does, verify update history of the file to see if changes could
<br>            create further problems. If they seem reliable, install newer version and 
<br>            see if problem is resolved. 
<br>    
<br>    Step 4 - If problem persists, contact developer.
