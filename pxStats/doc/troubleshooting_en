About
---------------------
This section was created to help the administrator of the stats library.
The stats library was designed as to require as little human intervention as 
possible. Nonetheless it is likely that errors will occur through time.
A few utilities have been developped as to help the user get things back on track. 



Section 1 - Data errors on only one machine.
------------------------------------------------------


Preconditions : 
------------------------------------------------------

- 2 or more machines currently have pxStats installed.

- They BOTH have the same main application language set
  in their config file.



Symptoms : (any of these)
------------------------------------------------------

1 - Different graphics are produced by both machines.

2 - Some graphics are absent on one of the two machines
    and not on the other.


Possible causes :
------------------------------------------------------
1 - The two(or more) machines have different versions of
    the stats library installed on them or different 
    versions of the crucial files.

2 - Graphic creation has been stopped on one of the two
    machines.

3 - Disks are full or access to disk is corrupted.



Recovery procedure:
-----------------------------------------------------   
1- Identify the source of the problem within the list 
   of possible errors.

2- If a machine has the wrong version of the stats 
   library files installed, install the same version
   as the working machine on the non-working machine.

3- Stop all stats library related activities by killing
   currently running process' and by turning off the
   related crontab entries. To do so, run this commands : 
   crontab -e  and write the # character in front of the 
   entries you want to turn off. 

4- Retrieve data from the working machine.

   To do so run this utility :

   .../pxStats/bin/tools/retreiveDataFromMachine.py login machineName  

   Warning : prior to running this script, make sure that the config files in the 
   .../pxStats/etc folder are properly filled !

5- relaunch graphic production

   To do so remove the # character you have placed in the crontab entries you have modified. 

   Remove any lock found in one of these folders : 

    ...pxStats/tmp/lockFiles/pxStatsStartup.lock
    or into the 
    .../pxStats/temp/fichiersDeVerrou/ folder and remove 

   Note: if crontab entry is set at the 15th minute of the hour, and it's hh:25:ss
         you might want to run launchGraphicCreation manually to see if everything goes well
         without having to wait untill the next hour.   

Warnings : The preceding script is not bulletproof. If files were being updated 
           throughout the entire time the transfer was being done, there is no
           way all the transferred files will be complete and accurate. You
           should thus make sure that the source machine is not doing any 
           intensive work of it's own(i.e stop the crons on that machine
           during transfer). Otherwise, rerun this script numerous time.



Section 2 Data recuperation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions : 
------------------------------------------------------

- At least one machine has pxStats installed.

- If only one of the machines has problems, the other
  machines do not have the same installation languages
  as the problematic one.

- If many machiens have the same installation language
  they either do not handle the same machines or they
  are both currently corrupted.

- If any of the preconditions is not met, see the other 
  section to find the section relative to you problems.


Symptoms : (any of these)
------------------------------------------------------

1 - Graphics are missing.

2 - Graphics appear, but are empty.

3 - Monitoring emails are no longer delivered.


Possible causes :
------------------------------------------------------
1 - Crontabs have been stopped on all of the machines.

2 - Disks are either full, or disk access has been lost.

3 - Someone stopped crontab during execution and corrupted 
   data. 

4 - SSH access to remote access is corrupted 

5- Emails transfers is corrupted.


Recovery procedure:
-----------------------------------------------------

1 - Make sure crontabs are currently active
    - ssh userName@problematicMachine
    - crontab -e 
    - Make sure no '#' character is found in front 
      of the crontab entry dedicated to pxStatsStartup 

2 - Make sure disk space is sufficient and that disk are accessible.
    -  ssh userName@problematicMachine
    -  go to the .../pxStats/data or .../pxStats/donnees/ folder.
    - Browse folders and see if the are ALL accessible.
    - At the same time, verify every folder for free disk space
      and make sure they are not full.

4 - SSH connections are lost :
    This will produce graphics with no data since no log files will be rsync'ed
    from the source machines to the pickling machines.

   - ssh username@problematicmachine
   - make sure automatix connection to log producing files
     is granted without password to the user which is running 
     the crontabs.



3 - In case of data courruption :(ssh connection had been lost, 
    brutal halting of pxStatsStartup execution)

     - ssh userName@problematicMachine
     - crontab -e : comment the crontab entry of pxStatsStartup.py
     - go to the .../pxStats/bin/debugTools/ folder
     - execute the following command : 
       setTimeOfLastUpdates.py "yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS"
       the time specified should be the hour prior to data corruption 
    - go to the .../pxStats/data/databases/databasesBackups and look
      for the newest backup that is older than the time of courruption.

    - copy that time exemple : 2008-05-04_12:16:00

    - go to the .../pxStats/bin/tools folder and execute the following
      command restoreRoundRobinDatabases.py "2008-05-04 12:16:00"
      Note : don't forget to replace the _ character with a space.

    - Go to the .../pxStats/temp/fichiersDeVerrou folder and 
      remove all lock files found there.
    
    - Go to the ...pxStats/tmp/lockFiles/ and remove any lock 
      files found there.
    
     - crontab -e : remove the # you had previously added to the entry.
        

5 - If everything seems ok but only monitoring emails are missing, 
    go to the "Section 3  Missing emails " section to fix the email
    problem



Section 3  Missing emails 
---------------------------------------------------------

Symptoms : (any of these)
------------------------------------------------------

1- Emails are no longer recevied from one or all of the machines


Possible causes :
------------------------------------------------------
1 - Crontabs are stopped on those machines.

2 - Email server is not distributing hte emails. 

3 - You're client is not receiving emails.


Recovery procedure:
-----------------------------------------------------

1 - Verify if graphics are up to date on the problematic machine
    If they are not, than a stopped crontab might be the cause.
    
    If so follow the following steps :

        - ssh userName@problematicMachine
        - To verify crontab type crontab - l
        -  if entry starts with '#' 
           example : #15 * * * * /apps/px/pxStatsFr/pxStats/bin/pxStatsStartup.py  > /dev/null 2>&1
           remove the #
        
        - If not, verify if process is not allready running. If not,
          verify if a lock file is blocking the program from running.
            - Go into the 
                ...pxStats/tmp/lockFiles/pxStatsStartup.lock
              or into the 
                .../pxStats/temp/fichiersDeVerrou/ folder and remove 
              pxStatsStartup.verrou if it is present( french installation)
            
        - Make sure all the .py files found under 
               .../pxStats/bin/ 
          and all the folders under it have permissions
          to be executed.
    

If graphics are up to date, than the program is running and the emails 
seem to be the only problem

2 - Verify if your e mail client is currently receiving emails properly. 

3- Verify if the parameters found in the .../pxStats/etc/config 
   configuration file are up to date. Verify with your email 
   provider that these parameters can be used on it's server 
   to send out emails.



Section 4 Request interface problems
----------------------------------------------------------

Symptoms( any of these ) :
----------------------------------------------------------

 - Request Page is not displayed at all 
 - Graphics cannot be produced 
 - Some graphics are produced but others are not 

Possible causes :
------------------------------------------------------
1 - .py files are not executable

2 - Server does not allow cgi script execution

3 - Permissions is not given to write graphics to the disk.

4 - Cgi message exchange has been corrupted by coding problems.


Recovery procedure:
-----------------------------------------------------


Remedy to cause 1 :
----------------------------

    1 - ssh username@machineHostingWebInterface
    
    2 - go into the filder where the web interface has been installed 
        ex : /web/pxStats/
    
    3 - go into the scripts/cgi-bin folder. Make sure all the files 
        found there are executable.

Remedy to cause 2 :
-----------------------------
    1 - ssh username@machineHostingWebInterface
    2 - go to the  /etc/apache2/sites-available
    3 - open up the appropriate file
    4 - make sure a section similar to this one is present : 
     ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /web/pxStats/scripts/cgi-bin/
     <Directory "/web/pxStats/scripts/cgi-bin/">
              AllowOverride None
              Options ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
              Order allow,deny
               Allow from all
      </Directory>


Remedy to cause 3 :
-----------------------------
1- ssh username@machineHostingWebInterface


2- if an english installation has been made 
   go to the ...pxStats/data/graphics/others/ folder.
   Make sure all the folders found under this 
   path(rrd and gnuplot ) and the ones under these
   ( they will be sporting the clients and sources names )
   give away the "write" permission to the web user.

3- if a french install has been made, go to the
    ...pxStats/donnees/graphiques/autres
   Make sure all the folders found under this 
   path(rrd and gnuplot ) and the ones under these
   ( they will be sporting the clients and sources names )
   give away the "write" permission to the web user.

Remedy to cause 4:
-------------------------------
Note : This problem is usually encountered when new file versions 
       are introduced into the files being used by the web interface.

       Correcting this bug will require modifying a few lines of code.

1 - ssh username@machineHostingWebInterface

2 - go to the /var/log/apache2 folder

3 - execute this command tail -f pxstats_access_log

4 - go to the web interface and execute a query that is giving you problems.

5 - watch the new lines being outputted by the  tail -f command.

6 - copy the query  line which includes a calls to graphicsrequestbroker
    which has jsut been added. this is the call you've just made

    example : 
    /scripts/cgi-bin/graphicsRequestBroker.py?querier=escape(%22graphicsRequestPage.py%22)&endTime=21-05-2008%2014%3A29%3A01&span=&fileType=tx&machines=pxatx&statsTypes=latence%2CnbreDeBytes%2CnbreDeFichiers%2Cerreurs&preDeterminedSpan=annuel&fixedSpan=Derniers%20365%20jours.&sourLients=ncp&combineSourlients=false&products=&lang=fr

7 - go to the place where the web interface is installed
    example :  /web/pxStats/script/cgi-bin/


8 - execute your copied query this way :
    .graphicsRequestBroker.py "?querier=escape(%22graphicsRequestPage.py%22)&endTime=21-05-2008%2014%3A29%3A01&span=&fileType=tx&machines=pxatx&statsTypes=latence%2CnbreDeBytes%2CnbreDeFichiers%2Cerreurs&preDeterminedSpan=annuel&fixedSpan=Derniers%20365%20jours.&sourLients=ncp&combineSourlients=false&products=&lang=fr"
    
    Note do not forget to leave a space between program name and parameters, and to wrap them with double quotes.

9 - look out for any printout which do no start with 

        HTTP/1.0 200 OK
        Server: NCSA/1.0a6
        Content-type: text/plain

    for example the exepected reply to you query would be :

        HTTP/1.0 200 OK
        Server: NCSA/1.0a6
        Content-type: text/plain

        images=../../pxStats/donnees/graphiques/autres/rrd/ncp/tx_ncp_20080521_14:29:01_latence_1annees_sur_pxatx.png+../../pxStats/donnees/graphiques/autres/rrd/ncp/tx_ncp_20080521_14:29:01_nbreDeBytes_1annees_sur_pxatx.png+../../pxStats/donnees/graphiques/autres/rrd/ncp/tx_ncp_20080521_14:29:01_nbreDeFichiers_1annees_sur_pxatx.png+../../pxStats/donnees/graphiques/autres/rrd/ncp/tx_ncp_20080521_14:29:01_erreurs_1annees_sur_pxatx.png;error=

    If anything else is printed above the header this will corrupt communications between the queried script and the querier.
    Investigate queried scripts( graphicsRequestBroker.py,  GnuQueryBroker.py, GnuPlotter.py,  RRDGraphicProducer.py,  RRDQueryBroker.py, GraphicsQueryBrokerInterface.py, StatsPaths,StatsDateLib etc  ) and find which onhe is doing debugging priting.


Section 5 Web interface problem
----------------------------------------------------------

Symptoms( any of these ) :
----------------------------------------------------------
    - None of the web page are being displayed.

Possible causes :
------------------------------------------------------
- Url is wrong or has been changed or dns does not
  recognise it.
- Apache server problem 


Solutions
----------------------------------------------------------
Verify both cause with the apache server administrator.
