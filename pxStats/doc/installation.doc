    Section 1.1 Requirements
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        Section 1.1.1 Software Requirements
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            
            Software requirement for execution.

                Python     : version 2.3 or greater.
                SSH        : Allows to connect and tranfer data /to/from other machines.
                Rsync      : Allows to synchronise data between machines.
                RRDTOOL    : Time-series storage and display system.
                Python-rrd : Python package.
                Gnuplot.py : Python package.
                Sundew     : Python package which is part of the MetPX project.

            If maintenance and or developpement is to be done the following 
            software will be required :

                pygettext : Allows to get .pot files from .py files.
                msgfmt    : Transforms .pot files into binary files readable by
                            pythons gettext module.

            
        Section 1.1.2 Hardware Requirements
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            
            
            -> Some parts of the software were developped with a multi-processor 
               machine architecture in mind. Perfomances will take a hit if program 
               is run on a single processor machine.    

            -> On average, under the current clients/sources configuration of metx 
               each client/source requires on the average 50 megs for it's 
               log files. Currently, 24 gigs are requried to house the files 
               of the 482 clients/sources which are spread on different machines.
            
               This space will be needed under ...pxstats/data/logFiles/
              ( or pxStats/donnees/fichiersJournalisation for a french install )
               if pickling is not done on the machine where orgininal logs reside.
                 
                This  machine can be an independant machine between the graphic
                producing machine and the log producing machine or the graphic
                producing machine itself.
                
                
            -> At least 6gb of disk space for graphics. Current cleaner configuration
               and number of graphics, combined with the current number of 
               client/sources keeps the space used under 1gb. That number could grow
               indefinatly based on cleaner settings and a growing number of
               client/sources.
               
               NOTE : The cleaner DOES NOT currently clean archives at all, meaning 
                      archives could be kept forever.
            
            
                This space will be needed under ...pxstats/data/graphics/
                or ...pxStats/donnees/graphiques/

            
            
             -> At least 800 megs of disk space for the current databases( 1.61 megs per client ).
                Right now the different databases take up 250 megs but a different 
                consolidation configuration or a growing number of client/sources 
                could make this number climb up greatly.
                
                This space will be needed under ...pxstats/data/databases/currentDatabases
                or .../pxStats/donnees/basesDeDonnees/basesDeDonneesCourantes 
                    
             -> At least 15gb of disk space for database backups. We currently keep 20
                backups(at ~< 800 megs each) saved at every 12 hours, wich gives us 
                access to the saved data of the past 10 days. Saving every 12 hours helps 
                us keep a limited number of backups while keeping the gap between backups
                small enough to hopefully keep data recevery times low.
                
                This space will be needed under .../pxStats/data/databases/databasesBackups
                or ...pxStats/donnees/basesDeDonnees/basesDeDonneesEmmagasinees
            
                
            -> At least 100 gb of disk space if you want to keep the pickles.
               Currently we are averaging a 8 megs per client per days of pickles kept.
               We recommend keeping pickle backups for as long as databsee backups are kept.
               If not the source data pickles will no longer be available if an error is 
               introduced within the databases but was not present within the pickles. 
               
               This space will be needed under ../pxStats/data/pickles/
               or .../pxStats/donnees/pickles

               WARNING : KEEPING pickles for too short a period will cause serious problems.

                -> Remove the .sample extension


            Section 2.2.1.1 Notes on the update frequencies in this file.
            ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                2.2.1.1.1 pxStatsFrequency
                -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Ideally, this should be run hourly. At the very least, it should be at 
                    as frequently as the artifact that is to be updated the most frequently.

                2.2.1.1.2 monitoringFrequency
                -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Monitoring should doest not need to be done at every hour. Anyways
                    this would send out to many emails to the administrator dimishing the 
                    chances of them being read.

                2.2.1.1.3 dbBackupsFrequency
                -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Backups should be made quite frequently as to shorten data 
                    recuperation in case of data curruption. However backing up too 
                    frequentlywill jack up disk usage if backups are to be kept for any
                    significant amount of time.

                2.2.1.1.4 pickleCleanerFrequency
                -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Since the pickles to keep is measured in days, running this daily
                    is optimal.

                2.2.1.1.5 generalCleanerFrequency
                -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    Update frequnecy found here should be based on what will be found in the 
                    clean_dir.conf file.

                2.2.1.1.6 xWebPageUpdatesFrequency
                -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    NOTES: The update frequency of web pages listed here will influence 
                           the update frequency of the artifacts lsited on these web pages.

                        -> dailyWebPageUpdatesFrequency
                          Since columbo users are expecting graphics to be updated hourly,
                          this should also be update hourly.
    
                        -> weeklyWebPageUpdatesFrequency
                           This could be updated daily or hourly if visualizing the 
                           progression of the week is desired. Otherwise it cold be update weekly.
                           More infrequently than that would make little sens.

                        -> monthlyWebPageUpdatesFrequency
                           Updating hourly is probably useless and will only add up to machine load.
                           If weeklies are updated frequently, hgaving these graphics updated once
                           per week seems optimal.

                        -> yearlyWebPageUpdatesFrequency
                           Like the monthly graphics, this should not be updated too often.
                           These are currently update monthly and this seem sufficiant.

                       -> totalWebPageUpdatesFrequency
                           Since they include all graphic types from daily to yearly,
                           this should be updated as frequently as the most frequently
                           updated web page.


            Section 2.2.2 Configuring the cleaners
            ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                
                Section 2.2.2.1 Setting up .../pxstats/etc/clean_dir.conf.sample
                --------------------------------------------------------------------
                    -> Go to the .../pxstats/etc/ folder.
                    
                    -> Download the clean_dir.conf.sample file template from
                    https://metpx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/metpx/trunk/pxStats/etc/clean_dir.conf.sample              
                    
                    -> Follow instructions found within file header.

                    -> Remove the .sample extension

                    Notes on the times used within the template : 
                    ---------------------------------------------------------------        
                    -> The only graphics wich should be cleaned up on a regular basis 
                       are the ones found under .../pxstats/data/graphics/others or 
                       .../pxStats/donnees/graphiques/autres
 
                    -> Graphics in the other section should be kept since they are 
                       part of those to be used within columbo's interface or
                       within the web archives.


            Section 2.2.3 Configuring the statsMonitor
            ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                -> Go to the .../pxstats/etc/ folder.

                -> Download the statsMonitoring.conf file template from
                https://metpx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/metpx/trunk/
                pxStats/etc/monitoringConf.sample

                -> Follow instructions found within file header.

                -> Remove the .sample extension


         Section 2.3 Setting up ssh
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            When setting up the config file in the .../pxstats/etc/ folder
            ( section 2.2.1 ) you can set up things so that different machine do 
            different tasks. 
            
            For example, things can be set up so that a central machine(x) creates the
            graphics, calls another machine(y) to do the pickling of data, wich in turn
            calls another machine(z) to get the log files it needs. That would actually 
            be the worst case scenario on the machine interconnectability scale.  
            
            To make sure everything works smoothly you need to set up
            ssh connections between the machines wich have a dependance in a way 
            that an ssh connection can be made using the client name specified 
            in the config file WITHOUT having to enter a password.       
                            
        
        Section 2.4 Setting up Crontabs      
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Here is a sample of a crontab file that's currently being run on 
            a development machine :
        
            2  * * * * /apps/px/pxStats/bin/pxStatsStartup.py  > /dev/null 2>&1
    
            To obtain the listing of all the entries in the crontab of the machine 
            you are setting up, type crontab -l.
            
            To edit this list, type crontab -e.
            
            Entries starting with the '#' character will be considered comment lines.

            2.4.1 launchGraphCreation.py 
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Should run hourly. Choice of minute at wich it starts is arbitrary 
            but it should be run at the top of the hour so that tasks have the time 
            to end prior to the start of the following hour so that hourly graphics
            seem up to date to the users. 



        Section 2.5 Installing the web interface 
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            The web interface is usally installed in a different section than the rest 
            of pxStats.

            To install it, follow the following steps:

            Section 2.5.1 Running the installation script 
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                1 - go into the ...pxStats/bin/tools/folder

                2 - run the following command ./installPxStatsWebInterface.py  path

            Section 2.5.1 Configuring apache 
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                1 - Make sure the ...path/scripts/cgi-bin is allowed to rung cgi scripts.
                2 - Make sure that for all languages, the .../path/html_language/archives
                    permissions are given so that the user can browse the archives.

        Section 2.6 Giving out execution permission
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                1 - Go to .../pxStats/bin/
                2 - Execute the following command : chmod a+x *.py
                3 - Execute the following command : chmod a+x */*.py



    Section 3: Installing as a second machine(or more) or as a mirror machine.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        This section covers the different aspects that need to be covered to start up 
        (or restart) a machine when another machine is currently producing graphics 
        for the same machine as the one you want to start up.  
    
        
        Section 3.1 What needs to be set up.    
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            With such a machine, all the configuration files and the crontabs that 
            are needed to be configured in a first machine still need to be 
            configured.
            
            If a different set up is to be used( example remotely generated pickles 
            vs locally generated pickles ) of if not all of the source machine will 
            be handled by the two machines, a manual set up(section 3.1.1) is
            required.
            
            Otherwise when the new machine will have the exact same behavior as the 
            mirrored machine, a transfer of settings(section 3.1.2) should be done. 
            
            3.1.1 Settings things up manually.
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Step 1 -> Open a console session to the allready running machine.
                Step 2 -> Open a console session to the new machine. 
                Step 3 -> Follow step 2.2 to 2.5 of this document.
                Step 4 -> Copy all the parameters that seem usefull from the mirrored
                        machine into the settings you are configuring on the new 
                        machine.
                Step 5 -> Add/modify/remove any parameters that is different from 
                        the mirror machine.          
                
            3.1.2 Downloading remote parameters.
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                -> To have the exact same configuration files as a remote machine
                you need to execute the following commands.
                
                scp -r login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/etc/* .../pxStats/etc/
                
                -> Some settings cannot be downloaded. The crontab entries 
                of the remote machine will need to be copied on the local machine.
                
                -> Step 2.3 setting up ssh will also need to be done ion the exact 
                same fashion as the mirrored machine on the local machine.

            3.2.1 On a mirror machine
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------  
                On a mirror machine a small utility allready exists wich will transfer
                all the monitoring artifacts, pickles, graphs, databases, backups from 
                one machine to another one.
                
                To use this utility use the following command : 
                python .../pxStats/bin/tools/retreiveDataFromMachine.py login remoteMachineName
                
                Please read warning on this utility prior to running it.
                run this utility PRIOR to running any crontab entries( pxStatsStartup.py )
                
                If for any reasons a long delay is to occur between the execution 
                of this utility, and the first execution of the crontabs, rerun the
                utility to make sure you have all the latest version of the different
                files.  
                
                Note : ...pxStats/etc/config needs to be configured PRIOR to calling 
                       retreiveDataFromMachine.py. 
                        
                    ssh permissions also need to be set as to permit connection
                    between local machine and mirrored machine without being asked
                    for a password.
            
                
            3.2.1 On a non-mirror machine
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                On a non mirror machine getting the files you require might prove to 
                be a bit tricky...
                
                Here is a way to get all the type of files you need.
                
                Note : Make sure you have enough disk space before attempting to 
                download all these files. Total disk space used can be considerable.
                
                3.2.1.1 Transferring log files :
                ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                You should only download the the log files of a particular machine 
                if the local machine will be the one producing the pickles for that
                particular machine.
                
                The command to use is this one :
                rsync -avzr --delete-before -e ssh login@logProducingMachine:/apps/px/log/ 
                .../pxStats/data/logFiles/logProducingMachine/ 
                
                3.2.1.2 Transferring monitoring artifacts :
                ---------------------------------------------------------------------
                
                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh 
                login@remoteMachine:/.../pxStats/data/monitoring/maxSettings.conf
                .../pxStats/data/monitoring/maxSettings.conf
    
                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh 
                login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/data/monitoring/maxSettings.confpreviousCrontab
                .../pxStats/data/monitoring/maxSettings.confpreviousCrontab
    
                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh 
                login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/data/monitoring/maxSettings.confpreviousFileChecksums
                .../pxStats/data/monitoring/maxSettings.confpreviousFileChecksums
    
                
                3.2.1.2 Transferring graphics :
                ---------------------------------------------------------------------
            
                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/data/graphics/
                .../pxStats/data/graphics/
                
                Note : If the current machine does not handle all of the machines that
                the source machine handles, you will be downloading some useless files.
                Never the less, if disk space allows it, it will be much easier to 
                download all the graphs instead of finding only the required ones. 
                
                3.2.1.2 Transferring pickles :
                ---------------------------------------------------------------------                        
                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/data/pickles/ 
                .../pxStats/data/pickles/ 
                
                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/data/picklesTimeOfUpdates/ 
                .../pxStats/data/picklesTimeOfUpdates/


                3.2.1.2 Transferring databases :
                ---------------------------------------------------------------------                              
                rsync -avzr  --delete-before -e ssh 
                login@remoteMachine:.../pxStats/data/databases/ 
                .../pxStats/data/databases/ 

                Transferring a huge amount of file might take a few hours.
                This means that the first type of filed(ex : pickles ) will be 
                missing some files by the time you finish to download the last type 
                of files(ex : databases). This might cause inconstancy.

                To overcome this, run the commands in a specific sequence numerous times.
                After a few times no new data will be present(except maybe for log files 
                wich will not be a problem). This can be seen by analysing the output 
                produced by the different rsync commands you have decided to run.




    Section 4 : Setting up a remote machine for pickling.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
        A remote machine used only for pickling will need the following :
        
        4.1 Required Files
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    
            -> All the found under the /apps/px/lib/stats/ folder 
            wich can be downloaded here 
            https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/metpx/trunk/sundew/lib/stats/  
                
            -> Logger.py   : usually found under /apps/px/lib/
                                
            -> PXPaths.py  : usually found under /apps/px/lib/
            
            -> PXManager   : usually found under /apps/px/lib/
            
            All of wich can be downloaded here : 
            https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/metpx/trunk/sundew/lib/ 
    
            
        4.2 Required disk space
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
            Depending on the number of handled machine, required disk space will vary
            greatly. Consult section 1.1.2 for details.
        
            
        4.3 Setting up ssh
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------    
            SSH will minimally need to be set up so that the machine generating the 
            graphics will be able to call the pickle generating machine without 
            asking the user to enter a password.
                
            If the pickle generating machine is not the one producing the log files
            it will also need a similar set up between itself and the log producing 
            machine.
