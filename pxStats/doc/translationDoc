About this document :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file was written for anyone using the pxStats library who might be interested 
on how the multi-lingual aspects were implemented. 



Background on the need for multi-lingual support :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PxStats was originaly developped to fit the internal requirements within environment 
Canada which required a bilingual approach to documentation and displayed languages.
Languages used were english and french.


Requirements :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To implement the solution as described below the following were required :

- pygettext python module.
- pygettext software, which is the python equivalent to xgettext.
- msgfmt software which compiles the pygettext output to binary format
- sameLanguagePotFileTranslator.py a time-saving utility found within pxStats.  


Guiding principles
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Application was originally written in english, documentation was in english  
  and everything outputted, from graphcis to webPages to emails were in english.

- Translation support had to be added with as little code change as possible while 
  keeping code as readable as possible.  

- Application had to be able to support as many languages as desired by users.

- Application had to be able to output artifacts in a different language than 
  the one used when calling the application.      
  
- Web pages had to be able to present the artifact in languages the artifacts 
  might not even have been generated for. Example a french web page showing
  graphics whose content is in english.
    


Implementation :
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration file(.../etc/config)
================================================================================
Everything starts here. This file is where you specify the following 
parameters :

- Main application language :

  This language will be the one used to set all the path towards the different 
  files produced by the application, the names of the pickles and pdatabases 
  produced and the application in which all the programs will be presented to 
  the user.
   
  Notes: There can be only one main application language.
         Language must be the first two letters of the language name. Ex : fr, en.



- Artifacts languages :
  
  These languages specify in which languages the different artifacts generated 
  by pxStats will be generated in. For example, a user might want to have french 
  as the main application language for it's administrator but english as the 
  artifacts language since the people who consult the artifacts speak english.
  
  Notes : Numerous languages can be specified here.
          Adding a second language will double the time spent producing artifacts and 
          so on for every other languages added.
             


- Web Pages languages.
  
    These languages specify in which languages the web pages need to be generated.
    Web page are generated very fast so adding more languages is not a problem.
    Web pages specified here must be specified in couples, stating A : the 
    language printed in the web pages and B the language in which the artifacts 
    in linked from inside the web page are in.  

    
Supported languages(.../lang/)
================================================================================
All the supported languages are found in the lang folder. Each folders found 
there contains the translation files needed for that particular language. 
To make things easier, the arborescence found under each language's folder is 
the same as the file being translated. Example ...pxStats/bin/webPages/test.py
would be found under ...pxStats/lang/bin/webPages/test


Explicit translation support( Translatable class )
================================================================================
Classes which want to support translation can inherit from the Translation class
found in the lib folder.
 
This will automatically add a getTranslatorForModule function to the 
class. This way, each class does not have to delcare it's own translator and if 
the translator method and if the translation themods are ever to change, we will
only have to change it at a single place.

Non-explicit translation support
================================================================================
If you are working with a binary file(.../pxStats/bin/) you will probably want
to translate part of you application, yet getting your module to derive from 
the Translatable class would make little sens. In that case you will need to 
use the language tools class found in the lib folder.

Supporting different language throughout a module
================================================================================
In the following sections, we will cover how to render a module translatable.
The common approach to this problem, however, allows for only one language to 
be used for translating text throughout the entire module.

PXStats, however has some modules which are requried to support multiple 
languages at the same time during the same execution.

The simple workaround found to counter this was to add as many proterties or 
parameters as needed to the classes which need to support more than one
language. Throughout the application execution, the translator being used will
be set to the language that needs to be usedat that point in time based on the
properties that were added to the class.

That way, a class or script could have as many translator as desired.





Steps towards translating a module
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is the series of steps to follow in order to get a module that is 
translatable.Please refer to the how-to section for details on each section.

1- Make sure language is supported by the application.

2- Make the content of your module translatable

3- Generate the .po file from your translatable module

4- Fill out the .po file with the required translation strings.

5- Generate a binary translation file from you .po file.

6- Use the binary file properly within you code.


How-to
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------   

Adding supported languages
===============================================================================
To add supported languages, you simply need to create a new folder in the 
lang section( ex : sp for spanish ) and create the necessary subfolders 
that reflect the pxStats arborescence.

Making the content of a module translatable
===============================================================================

- A class from whom instances are created should usually inherit from the 
  translatable type. 

- EVERY module should be modified as to conform to the folowing :
  - Every string that can be displayed to the user, be it a single-quoted or double quoted string sould be transformed in the following way :
    
    print "Hello World"
    print _("Hello World")
    
  - Triple quoted string should be split up in such a way that the translatable parts are conform to the aforementionned standard.
  
    Exemple : print """
              
              <html>
              
                Hello world   
              
              </html>
              
              """    
              
    becomes : print """
              
              <html>
              
              """ + _("Hello world") + \
              
              """
              
              </html>
              
              """   

              
Generating .po translation files from a translatable module
===============================================================================  
To generate a translation file from pygettext simply execute the following 
command in a console

pygettext moduleName 


Obtaining a completly filled .po for the same languages as the one used within the module.
============================================================================================  
Use sameLanguagePotFileTranslator.py  found in the tools section of pxStats.

Translating a .po file into a different language than the one used within the module.
============================================================================================  
To to this, you will need to open the .po file resulting from executing the 
"Generating .po translation" step with a text editor. For every "msgid" found you 
will need to fill the the following "msgstr" line with the appropriate translation.


When updating a script, the new .po you will unfortunatly have to refill
most of the .po file with translations form the previous version. A small utility 
is in the works  that will copy the cotent of an old .po file into a new one to 
save up some time.


Generating the binary translation file(s) from the translated .po file(s).
===============================================================================  
For all the generated .po file, do the following command  :
msgfmt .poFile outputfileName
  

Using the binary translation files within a program
===============================================================================

To use the translation file, you simply either have to get you class to derive 
from the Translatable type, or call the LanguageTools metohods directly.

If you would like to write up your own handling of translation files, you 
simply need to add the following lines to your code:
    
    import gettext
    ...
    translator = gettext.GNUTranslations( open( binaryTranslationFileName ) )
    
    _ = translator.gettext

    ...
    print _("Hello world")

If all steps were followed properly, this would print out a translated version of 
the Hello world message.
