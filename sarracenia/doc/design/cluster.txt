What does a cluster look like?

determine the topologies.

  standalone:
	router, sftp and apache on one node.

  switching/routing configuration:
	- ddsr
		one broker per node? 
		just one broker?

		ddsr - broker
		   pre-fetch validation would happen on the broker.
		   then re-post for the sara's on the movers.

		ddsr1 - data mover.
		ddsr2 - data mover.
		ddsr3 - data mover.
			.
			.
			.
		
		do we need a load balancer?

  data dissemination configuration.
    on a switching/router:
	Once delivery has occurred to all contexts, can you delete the file?
	just watch the log files and tick off as each scope confirms receipt.
	when last one confirmed, delete. (makes re-xmit difficult ;-)

	based on a file size threshold? if the file is too big, donÂ´t keep it around?


  data dissemination configuration.
	- multiple server nodes.  Each standalone.

	- dd - load balancer, just re-directs to a dd node?
		dd1,dd2, 

		broker on dd node has connection thereafter.
  data dissemination with a shared file system?
         dd - one broker.
	 dd1,dd2, ... all share the one big file system.


Use cases:

   somebody wants to transfer a 3 TiB file.

   somebody wants rock solid, op1hr service
   somebody wants to see a continuous feed of tiny files.

   someone (outside org) wants to send us data.
	- using straight sftp.
	- using dd-aware method.
	- using dd-watch.

   someone inside Gov. wants to do same.
