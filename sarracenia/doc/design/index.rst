 sr_Sarracenia Design Docs
===========================

Please note the nature of Design documents is that
they do not reflect the actual implementation.  Some of it
is ideas that were discarded, much of it is the basis for discussion.
When the design is settled and decisions made, the information
percolates down into the documentation (outside this directory.)
So the information here is of some interest to developers and
contributors, but not really useful to anyone else.

Current information: 

 - `Outline.html <Outline.html>`_
 - `design.html <design.html>`_
 - `plan.html <plan.html>`_

 - `biblio.html <biblio.html>`_ -- bibliography.

The rest are just notes which are likely out of date:

 - `accounts.html <accounts.html>`_
 - `components.html <components.html>`_ some initial guesses of necessary components.
 - `configuration.html <configuration.html>`_
 - `deltas.html <deltas.html>`_ Implementation supercedes this.
 - `sr_post_sample.html <sr_post_sample.html>`_  This is what the initial implementation was based on.
 - `message_considerations.html <message_considerations.html>`_ Implementation supercedes this.
 - `messages_v02.html <messages_v02.html>`_  superceded by sr_post.7
 - `monitoring.html <monitoring.html>`_  
 - `packaging.html <packaging.html>`_ 
 - `private.html <private.html>`_
 - `scope.html <scope.html>`_  the background information that evolved into to_cluster
 - `validation.html <validation.html>`_  early implementation in sr_sarra... more to come.
 - `webification.html <webification.html>`_ pipe dream downstream...
