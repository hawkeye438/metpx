Thinking about post messages

how to specify ´scope´ is still unsettled.

use a flag with a list?
	s=ddi-ddbeta-

repeat the same flag?
	s=ddi,s=ddbeta,s= ...

add a separate element to the post message
	<scope> = comma separated list of destinations.

Things to think about:
	- the post goes to all clients...
	- do we want all recipients knowing which scopes a message targets?

information about a scope might not be something to share with all consumers.
Putting it ´out of band´ makes some sense.  an AMQP header might make sense
to avoid modifying the message as it traverses switches, and making scope
information too easily available.

methods of addressing scope visibility:

	- Edit the scope field as we go? (deleting irrelevant scopes?)

	- always delete scope field when posting to xPublic?
	  (meaning have arrived at a ´destination´ scope?)

	- have a setting to delete scope under admin control at a specific
	  point?

Routing between scopes is always going to be under administrator control.
the inter-switch transfer will always be something the admins of the various
switches configure and need to be aware of.

if we post on xPublic on ddsr, and ddi is subscribed to it, then...
that´s fine.

Thinking about log messages
-------------------------------------------------------------

Log message contains:

is only emitted after processing of an announcement is completed, 
to indicate a final status of processing that announcement.

topic matches announcement message except...

v01.log.<source>.<consumer>...... 

version is protocol version, should increment in sync with notify.

start is as per post... just add fields after:

	<date> blksz blckcnt remainder blocknum flags baseurl relativeurl <flow> <status> <host> <client> <duration> 

------

	what if there are spaces in the file name?
	path should be url-encoded (so space is: %20 )

------

can we just space out the fields on a single line? or do we need fancier 
parsing....  one line is better, because grep etc... works, and 1 message 
per line is easier to parse.

Fields that needs to be there:

startdate <date-time> of transfer...
	-- perhaps just indicate duration of transfer in seconds, rather than 
	   two dates.  saves few bytes.

Enddate <date-time> of transfer ... 

status 
	-- ok or error code> ... use http ones?
		lots of good ones on wikipedia.

	-- should topic include status?
	       v01.log.200..... (then do not need it in the body...)
	   cant subscribe only to errors? likely not useful as too 
	   many errors to subscribe to.  perhaps just 200 for success, 
           and 400 for failure?  

	   No, think it is a pain. just leave it in body.

flow 
	-- application determined flow id, so the application can relate it 
	   to their processing.
	-- flow is a display field, unchanged/untouched by sarracenia.

consumer 
	-- talk to the data source, and determine what is a good label to 
	   share.  This is analogous to a company, or organization, and is 
	   likely not be unique to a single flow.
	-- subscriber chosen significant id, so that source can understand 
           who has received it.
	-- often subscriber will be on s12124.rogers.net ... not terribly 
           significant.
	-- client id is essentially a display field... based unchanged to 
           source.

	-- so only sources and clients need to negotiate the id´s,  we 
           just need to pass it in both directions transparently, and use 
           the identifier that they both know whenever appropriate.

is client the username used to connect to the broker and httpd instance?
	-- in which case, it is no longer transparent to the switches, 
	   and we have to say something about it.
              so the client will see it, and it is a ''monitoring unit''

system each ddi/ddsr instance will be defined as an internal client, so internal vs. actual deliveries
are easily distinguished... does that mean each layer of switches has an amqp username?

Thinking about Configuration / Administration

just a place holder.

really not baked yet. thinking is in configuration.txt
