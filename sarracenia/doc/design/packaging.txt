Figure out packaging? 
	- audit source to ensure full copyright headers applied.
	- the real command line interface.... uptil now was just working stuff.
	- what documentation should be available.
	- what packages should be built.


Goals:
	Can we make it really easy to build a ddsr node for techies to deploy a server ?
	so it is easy for others to adopt.   Recipe for a standlone single node config.
	- this would be linux only,
	- either a dpkg
	- a docker container?

        Make it easy for mortals to install the client.
	need self-contained windows install (an .exe) folks can download.
	because many clients in various departments use windows as clients,
	and many data sources may use windows also.


how to do languages & messaging....
	need English & French likely?
	just keep it in code, no natural language?
	There's fabulous ones:
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

metpx-sarracenia-server
	- depends: rabbitmq.
	- configuration sugar, to create a working/secure default to just start using.
	- dd_sara, and all the other components...
		log, and whatever.
		

metpx-sarracenia-client
	- dd_subscribe  -
		should dd_subscribe accept it's config file on standard input?
	- dd_post
	- dd_watch
	- dd_send...


there might be a meta-client... one that invokes the others appropriately...
	dd_cp -broker amqp://mygroup@ddsr/ -threads 5  <operation>  <source> [<srcurl>] <dest>
		-broker says what the URL of the AMQP broker is.
		-threads says how many local instances to start.
		<operation>
		    post4pickup  -- dd_post, and the switch is expected to pull
			-- requires <srcurl> to show URL remote will use to fetch.
			fires off: just the dd_post -threads ignored.

		    post2send    -- dd_post, then have local threads to send to sftp destination.
			sftp destination is likely a 'source' for the switch, triggering further fwding ...
			fires off: 1 dd_post and a 5 dd_sends, as appropriate.

		    subscribe    -- dd_subscribe, but with n local instances.
			fires off: 5 dd_sends, as appropriate.

		fires off 5 dd_subscribes, or 
		
		
	
start making other packages?
	redhat/centos?
	windows?

	do we make it 'pip' compatible?
		so on windows they install python, then pip pulls in deps?


Dunno. We probably need to try a bunch out and see what sticks?
