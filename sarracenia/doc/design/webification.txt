Status: Pre-Draft.  Deferred. 


Problem:   Every adopter is going to have to approach their firewall people
	and get them to approve use of AMQP protocol.  It's probably a good
        thing, but an impediment to deployment.

proposal:  Nowadays HTML5 has web sockets.  These are connections that start
	out as HTTP.  Once the validation is done, it hands off to any
        binary protocol.  In otherwords it becomes a socket.
        Sockets are what AMQP uses for communications anyways, so this
	would likely work.

There are two known websocket to AMQP gateways.

	- KAAZING - is commercial, proprietary.
	  here's a demo:

http://blog.kaazing.com/2013/04/01/remote-controlling-a-car-over-the-web-ingredients-smartphone-websocket-and-raspberry-pi/
	  the demo uses kaazing, and an additional level of indirection.. it writes 
          through a JMS, which is unnecessary.

	  at any rate, there is a direct AMQP gateway option.  
	  The project involves setting it up.
	

	- jwebsocket.org. is opeen source.

neither one seems to have python bindings, so the unpleasant problem is
either figuring that out... number of approaches:
	1. try to hook up ws4py and amqplib
	2. write new javascript versions of dd_post, dd_send, and dd_subscribe clients.
	3. try to write a new ws2amqp gateway in python.
		to work with something created in 1.

None of these are easy or short.  So this is deferred for now.
