Figure out packaging?

Goals:
	Can we make it really easy to build a ddsr node for techies to deploy a server ?
	so it is easy for others to adopt.   Recipe for a standlone single node config.
	- this would be linux only,
	- either a dpkg

        Make it easy for mortals to install the client.
	need self-contained windows install (an .exe) folks can download.
	because many clients in various departments use windows as clients,
	and many data sources may use windows also.


how to do languages & messaging....
	need English & French likely?
	just keep it in code, no natural language?
	There's fabulous ones:
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

metpx-sarracenia-server
	- depends: rabbitmq.
	- configuration sugar, to create a working/secure default to just start using.
	- dd-sara, and all the other components...
		log, and whatever.


metpx-sarracenia-client
	- dd_subscribe
	- dd_post
	- dd_watch



	
start making other packages?
	redhat/centos?
	windows?

	do we make it 'pip' compatible?
		so on windows they install python, then pip pulls in deps?


Dunno. We probably need to try a bunch out and see what sticks?
