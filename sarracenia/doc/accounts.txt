These usernames are significant in that they are visible to all. Need to be understandable.
they are wider scope, than a person... perhaps call them 'Accounts'.
they turn up as usernames in AMQP and HTTP.


So a Account is allocated for:

Each Source. (Alice)
   each source gets a source_<sourcename> exchange ... source_Alice. 
   on the posting switch.

   each source gets a 'log_<sourcename>' exchange ... log_Alice
   on the logging switch.

   their directories get disseminated as YYYYMMDD/Alice/...

   
Each Client (Bob)
    Client gets permission to access files (http level)
    Client gets permission to post log messages to log exchange 
	on the server that is sending them announcements.
    only exists in AMQP on the end broker.
	they authenticate to broker to get messages.

    also in apache at end server.

    All sources will see the client name in their logs.


Each Layer between Source and Client (ddsr,ddi,dd)   
    so each hop generates a log message, assigned to the layers.
    internal hops can be removed from stats easily.
    only exists in AMQP on the relevant brokers.


Is Speedo a source? ... 
	creates no data, only messages.

Does Monitoring need an account?


To store the accounts, do we create a sub-domain for ldap 
( dd.science.gc.ca, dd.collab.science.gc.ca) and put them in there?
