========================
Sarracenia Documentation
========================

.. danger::
  This package is not ready for use yet.  It is undergoing internal testing, and the 
  documentation is incomplete.  This note will be removed once the package documentation 
  is complete and usable.

Documentation comes in two varieties: Guides and Manual Pages.  The Guides provide give the 
overall idea of how to use the tools, with description of several components, use cases, and 
some sample configurations and runs.  The guides provide "Getting started" type information, 
describing the purpose, in general, of the various components needed for various jobs.

The Manual Pages, on the other hand, are reference material.  For each component or format, 
the manual page provides a complete reference that shows all the options that exist for that 
component, and also provides examples of usage. To learn the application, it is best to 
start with Guides. The Guides are also best read in order, as knowledge of each guide assumes 
one is familiar with the previous ones.

Once an initial configuration is established and the overall picture is understood, then the 
reference materials provides quick answers to specific questions.
