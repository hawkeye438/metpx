Injecting Data into a MetPX-Sarracenia Pump Network

  Caveat about file update strategies.  use case of a file file that is constantly updated,
  rather than issuing new files.)
   

A Sarracenia data pump is a web (or sftp) server with notifications for subscribers 
to know, quickly, when new data has arrived.  To find out what data is already available 
on a pump, view the tree with a web browser.  For simple immediate needs, one can 
download data using the browser itself, or a standard tool such as wget.
The usual intent is for sr_subscribe to automatically download the data 
wanted to a directory on a subscriber machine where other software 
can process it.   Note that this manual uses subscriptions to test
data injection, so the subscriber guide should likely be read before
this one.

Regardless of how it is done, injecting data means telling the pump where the data 
is so that it can be forwarded to and/or by the pump.   This can be done by either
using the active and explicit sr_post command, or just using sr_watch on a directory.  
Where there are large numbers of file, and/or tight timeliness constraints, invocation
of sr_post directly by the producer of the file is optimal, as sr_watch may provide
disappointing performance. Another explicit, but low frequency approach is the
sr_poll command, which allows one to query remote systems to pull data
into the network efficiently.

While sr_watch is written as an optimal directory watching system, there simply is no 
quick way to watch large (say, more than 100,000 files) directory trees. On 
dd.weather.gc.ca, as an example, there are 60 million files in about a million 
directories. To walk that directory tree once takes several hours.  To find new files, 
the best temporal resolution is every few (say 3) hours.  So on average notification 
will occur 1.5 hours after the file has showed up. Using I_NOTIFY (on Linux), it still 
takes several hours to start up, because it needs to do an initial file tree walk to 
set up all the watches.  After that it will be instant, but if there are too many 
files (and 60 million is very likely too many) it will just crash and refuse to work. 
These are just inherent limitations of watching directories, no matter how it is done.

With sr_post, the program that puts the file anywhere in the arbitrarily deep tree tells 
the pump (which will tell subscribers) exactly where to look. There are no system limits 
to worry about. That’s how dd.weather.gc.ca works, and notifications are sub-second, with
60 million files on the disk.  It is much more efficient, in general, to do direct 
notifications rather than pass by the indirection of the file system, but in small
and simple cases, it make little practical difference. 

In the simplest case, the pump takes data from your account, wherever you have it, 
providing you give it permission.  we describe that case first.

SFTP Injection
--------------

Using the sr_post(1) command directly is the most straightforward way to inject data
into the pump network.  To use sr_post, you have to know:

- the name of the local broker: ( say: ddsr.cmc.ec.gc.ca. )
- your authentication info for that broker ( say: user=rnd : password=rndpw )
- your own server name. (say: grumpy.cmc.ec.gc.ca )
- your own user name on your server (say: peter)

Assume the goal is for the pump to access peter's account via SFTP.  Then you need
to take the pump´s public key, and place it in peter's .ssh/authorized_keys.
On the server you are using (*grumpy*), one needs to do something like this::

  wget http://ddsr.cmc.ec.gca/config/pump.pub >>~peter/.ssh/authorized_keys

.. warning::
  **FIXME**: this config directory is not implemented yet.  need to get public key 
  by talking to an admin for now.

This will enable the pump to access peter's account on grumpy using his private key. 
So assuming one is logged in to Peter's account on grumpy, one can store the broker
credentials safely::

  echo 'amqps://rnd:rndpw@ddsr.cmc.ec.gc.ca' >> ~/.config/sarra/credentials.conf:


.. Note::
  Passwords are always stored in the credentials.conf file.

Now we just need to figure out where to send the file to.  
Aim a browser at:

.. warning::
   **FIXME**: doc tree not implemented yet either... you have to talk to an admin
   to get advice on this stuff.

.. note::
   These names correspond to business functions, not the machines that implement
   them.  The names will be implemented as aliases on pumps.
   ALLCAPS is just a convention to avoid confusion with hostnames, which are 
   generally lowercase, similar to C convention for macros. 


Lets assume the places you want to send to are:  DDIEDM,DDIDOR,ARCHPC. 
so the sr_post command will look like this::

  sr_post -to DDIEDM,DDIDOR,ARCHPC \
          -broker amqps://rnd@ddsr.cmc.ec.gc.ca/  \
          -url sftp://peter@grumpy/treefrog/frog.dna

If you find you are using the same arguments all the time,
it might be convenient to store them in a central configuration::
  
  blacklab% cat >~/.config/sarra/default.conf <<EOT

  broker amqps://rnd@ddsr.cmc.ec.gc.ca/
  to DDIEDM,DDIDOR,ARCHPC
  base_url sftp://peter@grumpy

  EOT

So now the command line for sr_post is just the url to for ddsr to retrieve the
file on grumpy::

  sr_post -url treefrog/frog.dna

a more real example::

  sr_post -to test_cluster \
  -broker amqp://guest:guest@localhost/ \
  -dr /var/www/posts/ \
  -u http://localhost:81/frog.dna

Either way, the command asks ddsr to retrieve the treefrog/frog.dna file by logging 
in to grumpy as peter (using the pump's private key.) to retrieve it, and posting it 
on the pump, for forwarding to the other pump destinations.
  
similar to sr_subscribe, one can also place configuration files in an sr_post specific
directory:: 

  blacklab% cat >~/.config/sarra/sr_post/dissem.conf <<EOT

  broker amqps://rnd@ddsr.cmc.ec.gc.ca/
  to DDIEDM,DDIDOR,ARCHPC
  base_url sftp://peter@grumpy

  EOT

and then::

  sr_post -c dissem -url treefrog/frog.dna

If there are different varieties of posting used, configurations can be saved for each
one. 

.. warning::
   **FIXME**: Need to do a real example. this made up stuff isn´t sufficiently helpful.

   **FIXME**: sr_post does not accept config files right now, says the man page.  True/False?

   sr_post command lines can be a lot simpler if it did.

sr_post typically returns immediately as its only job is to advice the pump of the availability
of files.  The files are not transferred when sr_post returns, so one should note delete files 
after posting without being sure the pump actually picked them up. 

.. NOTE::

  sftp is perhaps the simplest for the user to implement and understand, but it is also
  the most costly in terms of CPU on the server.  All of the work of data transfer is
  done at the python application level when sftp acquisition is done, which isn´t great.

  a lower cpu version would be for the client to send somehow (sftp?) and then just
  tell where the file is on the pump (basically the sr_sender2 version.)

Note that this example used sftp, but if the file is available on a local web site,
then http work work, or if the data pump and the source server share a file system,
then even a file url could work.  


HTTP Injection
--------------

If we take a similar case, but in this case there is some http accessible space,
the steps are the same or even simpler if no authentication is required for the pump
to acquire the data.  One needs to install a web server of some kind.  

Assume a configuration that show all files under /var/www as folders, running under
the www-data users.  Data posted in such directories must be readable to the www-data
user, to allow the web server to read it.  The server running the web server
is called *blacklab*, and the user on the server is *peter*.  running as peter on blacklab,
a directory is created under /var/www/project/outgoing, that is writable by peter,
which results in a configuration like so::

  cat >>~/.config/sarra/watch/project.conf <<EOT

  broker amqp://feeder@localhost/
  url http://blacklab/
  document_root /var/www/project/outgoing
  to blacklab

  EOT

then a watch is started::

  sr_watch project start

.. warning::
  **FIXME**: real example.

  **FIXME**: sr_watch was supposed to take configuration files, but might not have
   been modified to that effect yet.

While sr_watch is running, any time a file is created in the *document_root* directory, 
it will be announced to the pump (on localhost, ie. the server blacklab itself.)::

 cp frog.dna  /var/www/project/outgoing
  
.. warning::
  **FIXME**: real example.

This triggers a post to the pump.  Any subscribers will then be able to download
the file.

.. warning:: 
   **FIXME**. too much broken for now to really run this easily...
   so creating real demo is deferred.   


Polling External Sources
------------------------

Some sources are inherently remote, and we are unable to interest of affect them.
One can configure sr_poll to pull in data from external sources, typically web sites.
The sr_poll command typically runs as a singleton that tracks what is new at a source tree
and creates source messages for the pump network to process.  

External servers, especially web servers often have different ways of posting their
product listings, so custom processing of the list is often needed.  That is why sr_poll
has the do_poll setting, meaning that use of a plugin script is virtually required
to use it.  

.. warning::
  **FIXME**: sr_poll example neeeded.

  **FIXME**: example do_poll scripts should be in distribution.



Report Messages
---------------

If the sr_post worked, that means the pump accepted to take a look at your file.
To find out where your data goes to afterward , one needs to examine source
log messages. It is also important to note that the initial pump, or any other pump 
downstream, may refuse to forward your data for various reasons, that will only
be reported to the source in these report messages.  

To view source report messages, the sr_report command is just a version of sr_subscribe, with the
same options where they make sense. If the configuration file (~/.config/sarra/default.conf) 
is set up, then all that is needed is::

  sr_report

to view report messages indicating what has happenned to the items inserted into the 
network from the same pump using that account (rnd, in the example.) One can trigger 
arbitrary post processing of report messages by using on_message plugin.

.. warning::
   **FIXME**: need some examples.



Large Files
-----------

Larger files are not sent as a single block.  They are sent in parts, and each
part is fingerprinted, so that when files are updated, unchanged portions are
not sent again.  There is a default threshold built into the sr\_ commands, above
which partitioned announcements will be done by default.  This threshold can
be adjusted to taste using the *part_threshold* option.

Different pumps along the route may have different maximum part sizes.  To
traverse a given path, the part must be no larger than the threshold setting
of all the intervening pumps.  A pump will send the source an error log
message if it refuses to forward a file.

As each part is announced, so there is a corresponding report message for
each part.  This allows senders to monitor progress of delivery of large
files.

Reliability and Checksums
-------------------------

Every piece of data injected into the pumping network needs to have a unique fingerprint (or checksum.)
Data will flow if it is new, and determining if the data is new is based on the fingerprint.
To get reliability in a sarracenia network, multiple independent sources are provisioned.
Each source announces their products, and if they have the same name and fingerprint, then
the products are considered the same.

The sr_winnow component of sarracenia looks at incoming announcements and notes which products
are received (by file name and checksum.)  If a product is new, it is forwarded on to other components
for processing.  If a product is a duplicate, then the announcement is not forwarded further.
Similarly, when sr_subscribe or sr_sarra components receive an announcement for a product that is already 
present on the local system, they will examine the fingerprint and not download the data unless it is different.
Checksum methods need to be known across a network, as downstream components will re-apply them. 

Different fingerprinting algorithms are appropriate for different types of data, so 
the algorithm to apply needs to be chosen by the data source, and not imposed by the network.
Normally, the 'd' algorithm is used, which applies the well-known Message-Digest 5 (md5sum) 
algorithm to the data in the file.

When there is one origin for data, this algorithm works well. For high availability, 
production chains will operate in parallel, preferably with no communication between
them.  Items produced by independent chains may naturally have different processing
time and log stamps and serial numbers applied, so the same data processed through 
different chains will not be identical at the binary level.   For products produced 
by different production chains to be accepted as equivalent, they need to have 
the same fingerprint.

One solution for that case is, if the two processing chains will produce data with 
the same name, to checksum based on the file name instead of the data, this is called 'n'.  
In many cases, the names themselves are production chain dependent, so a custom 
algorithm is needed. If a custom algorithm is chosen, it needs to be published on
the network::

 http://dd.cmc.ec.gc.ca/config/msc-radar/sums/

    u.py

So downstream clients can obtain and apply the same algorithm to compare announcements
from multiple sources.

.. warning::
   **FIXME**: science fiction again:  no such config directories exist yet. no means to update them.
   search path for checksum algos?  built-in,system-wide,per-source?

   Also, if each source defines their own algorithm, then they need to pick the same one
   (with the same name) in order to have a match. 

   **FIXME**: verify that fingerprint verification includes matching the algorithm as well as value.

   **FIXME**:  not needed at the beginning, but likely at some point.
   in the mean time, we just talk to people and include their algorithms in the package.

.. NOTE::

  Fingerprint methods that are based on the name, rather than the actual data, 
  will cause the entire file to be re-sent when they are updated.  


Labelling Interesting Flows
---------------------------

Those injecting data have the freeform attribute 'flow' available to assign an arbitrary label
to a message, like a transaction id, to be able to follow a particular file though the network.

  
Post Overrides
--------------

What if there is some piece of metadata that a data source has chosen for some reason not to
include in the filename hierarchy?  How can data consumers know that information without having
to download the file in order to determine that it is uninteresting.  A typical example would be
weather warnings.  The file names might include weather warnings for an entire country.  If consumers
are only interested in downloading warnings that are local to them, then, a data source could
use the on_post hook in order to add additional headers to the message.

In order to use the additional headers, subscribers would need to implement and on_message hook on their
end, which would examine the non-standard header, and perhaps decide to avoid retrieving the file by
returning false from the hook script.

.. note::
  With great flexibility comes great potential for harm. The path names should include as much information
  as possible as sarracenia is built to optimize routing using them.  Additional meta-data should be used
  to supplement, rather than replace, the built-in routing. 

To add headers to messages being posted, one can use the post_override plugin. In a configuration
file, add the following statements::

  post_override CAP_province Ontario
  post_override CAP_area-desc Uxbridge - Beaverton - Northern Durham Region
  post_override CAP_polygon  43.9984,-79.2175 43.9988,-79.219 44.2212,-79.3158 44.4664,-79.2343 44.5121,-79.1451 44.5135,-79.1415 44.5136,-79.1411 44.5137,-79.1407 44.5138,-79.14 44.5169,-79.0917 44.517,-79.0879 44.5169,-79.0823 44.218,-78.7659 44.0832,-78.7047 43.9984,-79.2175
  on_post post_override

So that when a file advertisement is posted, it will include the headers with the given values.
The post_override plugin can also be used to override built-in header values, for example, source,
or to_cluster, to alter addressing in-flight.  This example is artificial in that it statically
assignes the header values which is appropriate to simple cases.  For this specific case,  it
is likely more appropriate to implement a specialized on_post plugin for Common Alerting Protocol 
files to extract the above header information and place it in the message headers for each
alert.




Efficiency Considerations

It is not recommended to put overly complex logic in the hook scripts, as they execute synchronously with
post and receive operations.  Note that the use of built-in facilities of AMQP (headers) is done to
explicitly be as efficient as possible.  As an extreme example, including encoded XML into messages
will not affect performance slightly, it will slow processing by orders of magnitude that one will not
be able to compensate for with multiple instances (the penalty is simply too large to overcome.)

Consider, for example, Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) messages for weather alerts.  These alerts routinely 
exceed 100 KBytes in size, wheras a sarracenia message is on the order of 200 bytes.  The sarracenia messages
go to many more recipients than the alert: anyone considering downloading an alert, as oppposed to just the ones
the subscriber is actually interested in, and this metadata will also be included in the report messages,
and so replicated in many additional locations where the data itself will not be present.

Including all the information that is in the CAP would mean just in terms of pure transport 500 times 
more capacity used for a single message.  When there are many millions of messages to transfer, this adds up.
Only the minimal information required by the subscriber to make the decision to download or not should be 
added to the message.  It should also be noted that in addition to the above, there is typically a 10x to 
100x cpu and memory penalty parsing an XML data structure compared to plain text representation, which
will affect the processing rate.
