The simplest way to transfer a file. If Bob trusts Alice, he gives puts her ssh public 
key in his ~/.ssh/authorized_keys On AliceServer, 

sftp -r frogdna bob@bobserver:.

or:

rsync -av frogdna bob@bobserver:.

# This might not work if there are firewall between Alice's and Bob's servers, or
# if the routing is poorly configured, or 
# if bob Doesn't have a server, or if 
# Bob doesn't have access to sftp or rsync.
# It also requires a certain level of trust between Alice & Bob.
