Log message contains:

is only emitted after processing of an announcement is completed, to indicate a final status of processing
that announcent.

topic matches announcement message except...
v01.log....

sz sum baseurl relativeurl
<startdate> <enddate> <status> <flow> <client>

what if there are spaces in the file name?
do we escape with \ or is it url-encoded %20? or something? just need to know.

can we just space out the fields on a single line? or do we need fancier parsing....
for v01, perhaps just use spaces?

stuff that needs to be there:
start <date-time> of transfer...
End <date-time> of transfer ...
status 
	-- ok or error code> ... copy use http ones?
	-- 200 OK
	-- use 4xxx series to report most issues.

flow 
	-- application determined flow id, so the appication can relate it to their processing.
	-- flow is a display field, unchanged/untouched by sarracenia.

client 
	-- talk to the data source, and determine what is a good label to share.
           this is analogous to a company, or organization, and is likely not be unique to a single flow.
	-- subscriber chosen significant id, so that source can understand who has received it>
	-- often subscriber will be on s12124.rogers.net ... not terribly significant.
	-- client id is essentially a display field... based unchanged to source.

	-- so only sources and clients need to negotiate the idÂ´s,  we just need to pass it 
	   in both directions transparently, and use the identifier that they both know
	   whenever appropriate.

is client the username used to connect to the broker and httpd instance?
	-- in which case, it is no longer transparent.
	-- then we have to say something about it.

system each ddi/ddsr instance will be defined as an internal client, so internal vs. actual deliveries
are easily distinguished... does that mean each layer of switches has an amqp username?
