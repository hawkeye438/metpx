This is a problem to be addressed after the basic proof of concept is demonstrated.

MetPX-sundew runs as an administrator configured tool.
having configurations entirely in configuration files makes sense for that.
We also have positional significance (config file options apply from top down in file.)

MetPX-sarracenia, is intended to be more user facing and interactive.
User facing commands ought to have robust command line parsing.

dd-subscribe and dd-post, likely need more polish here.

How to do this is not obvious...

It would appear that optparse, want to do it elegantly.


read options from 

	$DD_ROOT (default if not present, /etc/dd/ )
	~/.dd
	.dd
	commandline

have them work together.

Don't want to change the config file format... hmm.. maybe we should...
lot's of work here.

what's wrong with argparse?
	- no ordering 
	- cannot repeat arguments

so if you want to have similar to:

	reject ^x.z
	reject ^x.w
	accept ^x

	accept ^z.
	
then you don't ...
so it looks like it is just incompatible.  maybe just have a series of keywords on the command line 
with a line separator?

dd-subscribe directive='directory /home/cc ' reject ^x.z;reject ^x.w;accept ^x;accept ^z;'

then just split on ; and run it through the same parser?
