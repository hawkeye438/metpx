afsiext:  user name assigned to us to retreive data on cmcdata server
	client will not see this, private between source and ingest switch.

ec_cmc:   Account assigned for AMQP access. (rabbitmq username)
	clients will see this... it is a public label for the source.

dd-post -w exp13 NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif sftp://afsiext@cmcdataserver/data/NRDPS/outputs amqp://ec_cmc@ddi/NRDPS/GIF/

file is 457 bytes, blocksize is 0.
flow is 'exp13' (by default, would be 'default')  user settable, just passes through. 
DMS guys will appreciate this, for labelling warning flows.
checksum is done on actual data, not the file name, or a script
	- this is default behaviour.

need an option to checksum only the name...
	-namesum ?

dd-post connects to the 'ec_cmc' exchange with the ec_cmc username on bunny-op

posting is:

v01.notify.ec_cmc.NRDPS.GIF.NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif
201506011357.345 457 1 0 0 d <md5sum> sftp://afsiext@cmcdataserver/data/NRPDS/outputs/NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif NRDPS/GIF exp13

  -- blocksize is 457  (== file size)
  -- block count is 1
  -- remainder is 0.
  -- block number is 0.
  -- d - checksum was calculated on the body.
  -- Relative used to store relative destination directory
  -- flow is an argument after the relative path.

dd-validate is subscribed to bunny-op
	- checks that the block-size is legal.
	- modifies the destination directory to YYYYMMDD/ec_cmc/NRDPS/GIF/
	- runs validscript on the data.
		- IT Sec may want arbitrary scanning of data depending on source.
		- only after the scan is complete do we post to the next hop.
		- so the timing between post and accept can be significant.
	- posts the result to the normal exchange (xpublic?)

also emits a log message to log exchange:
v01.log.ec_cmc.ssc_ddsr.NRDPS.GIF.NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif
201506011357.345 457 1 0 0 d <md5sum> sftp://afsiext@cmcdataserver/data/NRPDS/outputs/NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif YYYYMMDD/ec_cmc/NRDPS/GIF/ exp13 202 ddsr1.cmc.ec.gc.ca ssc_ddsr 0.1 

if we go with HTTP error codes, then...
	-- 202 is HTTP status code for ''Accepted'' meaning accepted for processing.

other options:
	-- 400 bad request, in case of bad blocksize or other issue.
		
based on the v01.notify above the log one..., 

then dd-sara pulls the file in, and puts it on a local disk, in 
	/apps/dd/db/YYYYMMDD/ec_cmc/GIF/NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif
	and it knows the root of the web tree is /apps/dd/... ?

then it needs to re-announce:

v01.notify.ec_cmc.NRDPS.GIF.NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif
201506011357.545 457 1 0 0 d <md5sum> http://ddsr1.cmc.ec.gc.ca/db  YYYYMMDD/ec_cmc/NRDPS/GIF/NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif

?

dd-sara then emits a log entry:
v01.log.ec_cmc.ssc_ddsr.NRDPS.GIF.NRDPS_HiRes_000.gif
201506011358.345 457 1 0 0 d <md5sum> http://ddsr1.cmc.ec.gc.ca/db YYYYMMDD/ec_cmc/NRDPS/GIF/ exp13 200 ddsr1.cmc.ec.gc.ca ssc_ddsr 0.1 

	- fields as in notify, log.<source>.<dest>
	- flowid: 'exp13'
	- status codes (http) 200 means successful, so at this point, the file has made it to ddsr.
	- host that retrieved.
	- on whose behalf (ssc_ddsr account is AMQP user used on ddsr, one per layer of switching ?) 
	- duration of transfer in seconds.
	
then a client with dd_subscribe pulls it down, based on the notify above.

then there is another hop, similar to the above, to get to dd1.weather.gc.ca
