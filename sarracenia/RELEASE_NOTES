------------- Below some notes for the initial release ---------------------------------------------

1- dd.weather.gc.ca is Environment Canada's website where a wide variety of meteorological products are
   made available to the public. The website servers publish an amqp message containing
   the URL for each product posted as soon as it is available on the website. Any application which can 
   connect to an AMQP broket and retrieve via http could be used to obtain data from the server in
   real-time. There is a wide variety of languages with theses capabilities available on virtually any
   computing platform. We have produced some simple clients for demonstration purposes.

2- dd_subscribe is a python program that uses python-pika to receive these amqp messages
   and retrieve the web products and place them in a chosen local directory.

3- dd_subscribe takes one argument: a config file. 
   If you want dd_subscribe not to retrieve the products but only post the URL on standard
   output, execute:   dd_subscribe -n config_file

4- The config file is simple (see dd_subscribe manpage).
   The specified defaults for the config file options are valid and
   working at the time this release was done.  The config files may contain :

      a) credentials for the rabbitmq server, these options are 

               host               default  host          dd.weather.gc.ca
               port               default  port          5672
               amqp-user          default  amqp-user     anonymous
               amqp-password      default  amqp-password anonymous


      b) amqp exchange settings to be able to receive the desired notifications (URL)

              exchange            default  exchange      cmc
              exchange_type       default  exchange_type topic
              exchange_key        no default ... 
                                  
         - several exchange_key options may be declared
         - to give a correct value to the exchange key, browse the following website
           http://dd.weather.gc.ca  and pick any directories where the products are 
           interesting for you. For each directory use the option exchange_key as follow :

                 exchange_key  exp.dd.notify.directory1.subdirectory2.*.subdirectory4.#

                 where     exp.dd.notify. is a mandatory prefix
                           *              replace a directory name (one * per directory)
                           #              stands for the remaining possibilities


      c) http credentials (not used for now... might be implemented for restricted products)

               http-user          default  http-user     None
               http-password      default  http-password None


      d) delivery specifications

               lock               default  lock          .tmp
               directory          default  directory     .
               accept             default  accept        None
               reject             default  reject        None
               mirror             enabling mirror        False
               flatten            default flat char.     '/'

        
         - The lock option is a suffix given to the file during the download
           and taken away when it is completed... This gives a mean to avoid
           processing the file prematurely.

         - The option directory  defines where to put the files on your server.
           Combined with accept/reject options, the user can select the
           files of interest and their directories of residence.
           Theses options are processed sequentially. A product rejected is never downloaded.
           Accepted products are places under the closest directory option declared above the
           accept option that picked it. The accept and reject option used regexp to match
           URL.

           ex.     directory /mylocal/myradars
                   accept    .*RADAR.*

                   directory /mylocal/mygribs
                   reject    .*Reg.*
                   accept    .*GRIB.*
           
         - The option mirror, if set to True, will put the files into a directory tree
           similar to the one it resides on dd.weather.gc.ca except that the basename of
           the tree will be the path set by the directory option.
           
         - The option flatten, sets a character that will be used to rename the file from
           its path on dd.weather.gc.ca replacing the '/' by the flatten character setting.
           The file will placed with that extended name in the directory defined by the directory
           option.
           

5- When executed, dd_subscribe creates a queue name that should be unique and puts
   it into a file ."configname".queue


6- Under samples/config you will find working configuration files provided as is
   without garanty. Under samples/program you will find other programs we played with.

7- FUN : sarracenia  :  another rare, mostly carnivorous, canadian plant... (as sundew,columbo)
